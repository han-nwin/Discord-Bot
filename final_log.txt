  - 2024-10-31 | 
  - 2024-12-11 | Progression on top 3 goals this week:

1. Manychat: finished and tested Manychat flow. Just need to create deeplink after listing creation. ‚úÖ
2. Brand registry: awaiting pictures from supplier to submit for brand registry. Should be done today or tomorrow.
3. Gather information for  packaging design to give to designer: ongoing. I have been working so haven‚Äôt have time to sit down a brainstorm well. But still writing down ideas as they come. Deadline: Saturday or sunday!
  - 2024-12-09 | Top 3 goals this week:

1. Perfect my Manychat flow. By Saturday.
2. Have sample pictures from supplier and submit for Brand Registry. By Wednesday.
3. Gather information for  packaging design to give to designer. By Friday
  - 2024-12-07 | I can‚Äôt wait to share this week progress because it is going well and set my next week up for success!

Reflection:

Top three: 

- Trademark: ‚úÖ - This means I can finally start working on  Manychat flow and Insert Card this weekend.
- Suppliers shipped out the revised batch of the add-on products - if everything they sent over goes well, I have 3 suppliers for my product so the balls are in my court. 
- Finished the digital add-on product for review via Manychat

Roadblocks: Brand name search. I found having arbitrary or fanciful brand name would highly increase your chance to have brand name approved by USPTO per my attorney. But finally got one brand name now and happy that it‚Äôs done!

Next steps for the next week:
- Brand Registry.
- Packaging Design: awaiting final packaging size from our supplier.
 - Write a purchasing contract and bulk order.
  - 2024-12-05 | Top four goals this week

- Trademark name search: trademark attorney advised me to look for more descriptive name so it has less likeliness of confusion to other existing brands. Solution: I‚Äôm using more affordable trademark name search services on Fiverr with fast turnaround time to do deep search for me. I should results back tomorrow and will talk further with my attorney to get trademark filed by end of week
- Follow up with suppliers on revised add-on products: Done!
- Start writing contract to supplier for bulk order: halfway done. Just need to finalize trademark so I can get my custom packaging and logo designed. 
- Add-on digital product: today, i have finished my digital add-on product to get more review. Just need to slap on the brand name and call it a day üòÅ
- Extra: I‚Äôm watching the whole listing creation modules again and taking careful notes on the requirements.
  - 2024-12-02 | 1. Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who are to grow alongside you and learn from them.
2. When you said you will do something tomorrow, it‚Äôs very unlikely that will happen. Do it today instead!
3. Continue growing and learning. Have some respect for yourself and level up! üöÄ
  - 2024-12-02 | Top three: 

- follow up with trademark attorney on trademark process and name search. - due tuesday
- follow up with suppliers on revised add-on products. - due Wednesday
- start writing contract to supplier for bulk order. - due Friday
  - 2024-12-01 | Reflection on goals: 
- Trademark: my first choice of word mark came back with 65% chance of having it approved by USPTO. Attorney advised to find a substitute trademark name with for more than 80% of approving by USPTO. I submitted the alternative name to the attorney. Awaiting his response and search result on Monday.
- Testing out competitors and sample products: even though not even half of the sample products came in, I have found my most preferred model of the product since it is user friendly, more functional, and sturdier than many other models. An edge on this model is it is not sold on Amazon yet while all three of my top three suppliers carry this product so I have my options opened üôÇ
 
Stage: still on Sourcing phase. 
- Once the trademark process is finalized and filed, things will get moving quicker as I am able to start creating the logo, having my designer to design a color box, and redesign my existed manychat flow toward the current product. 
- Add-ons: I‚Äôm testing out one safety feature for my current product now so it‚Äôs a bit time consuming. If by Thursday next week I could not finish the testing, i will go with my back up add-on product.
- Goal: Have everything for bulk order ready by end of this week or next week since there are still some samples have not arrived for testing. After that, I will book a call with anh Minh for verification prior to placing the order.
  - 2024-11-28 | Happy Thanksgiving everyone! It‚Äôs been an honor being a part in the Shifu family with you all! I wish us many more successes together in the future ü•≥
  - 2024-11-27 | Top 3:

1. Trademark: Getting my mark trademarked for a better price than the previous IP accelerator! Should be able to submit all paperwork by end of week.

2. Make insert card + new digital add-on product: got ideas from chatgpt and is working on a digital add-on product now.

3. Test out competitors‚Äô products: plan to test out 4 out of 5 products today.
  - 2024-11-25 | Top 3:

1. Reach out to trademark attorney regarding previous mark  with new product in a different category. I want to see if there is any other ways to move forward with this mark,l. If not, a new trademark might be required.

2. Make insert card + new digital add-on product

3. Test out competitors‚Äô products

  - 2024-12-09 | Oh yeah I gotta do it too üòÇ
  - 2024-12-09 | This is very good idea sis! Thank you for sharing! I‚Äôll place QR code everywhere appropriate then üòÇüòÇ
  - 2024-12-08 | Thank you brother! I‚Äôll make sure to create a convenient pathway to delete the ‚Äúreview for gift‚Äù path if needed to later.
  - 2024-12-08 | Thanks Tim! Would giving away free e-book be a violation to Amazon‚Äôs policy?

  - 2024-12-02 | Thanks for sharing <@1168356026471436323> ! I understand some bank would not let you do balance transfer within the same bank. But if you choose a different bank to do balance transfer to, it would work.
In your case, does it work for business credit card as well?
  - 2024-11-28 | Anything that you can think of that is claimed to treat or cure something on your body can be subjected to FDA restriction  ü•≤. For me, I would still try to create a dummy listing like Minh said to see if FDA 510k clearance is required.
  - 2024-11-28 | Hi <@1261547592177811456>, I have had some experience with FDA 510k pre-approval number with my previous product. I had to let go of the previous product due to the FDA 510k number from my supplier was not sufficient for my product. 

Once you finished creating the listing, your listing will show ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù as it is still pending Seller Central‚Äôs approval. You can check back in a couple hours or the next day and the listing will likely become inactive and likely you violation report from Seller Central if the product is deemed a medical device and requires the 510k clearance number to clear it for public use. 

Many suppliers will require you to place an order or percentage of your bulk order before they can send you the 510k report. I have found a loophole to obtain the 510k number without paying but the FDA 501k number still doesn‚Äôt work. DM me if you have any question. I can guide you through it.

  - 2024-12-05 | Thank you Jamie for looking out for me! üôå I‚Äôll definitely reach out when questions arise!
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi brother Jamie, thank you for reaching out üòÅ

Here are a couple updates from me today:

1. Trademark: the brandname search continued to be a challenge for me even though i vetted USPTO and Google prior to submitting them to my attorney. But my attorney seems to always be able to find a registered brand with similar name that can have USPTO to potentially block my application. Solution: I‚Äôm seeking help from a couple gigs on Fiverr that do brand name search for me for cheaper prices ($10-$30/name). if i have better odd, I‚Äôll file trademark with the brand name right away. 

2. Digital add-on product: i‚Äôm finishing up the add-on digital ebook for my customers to get reviews from them

3. Finalizing add-ons: i just finalized add-ons for my main product as well. My suppliers are sending the addon over for me to take a look at. I have 3 suppliers for this product. One of them communicate better than the other two so i will likely go with him and keep the other 2 as reserve
  - 2024-10-28 | Another issue when it comes to starting all over again is that I have already submitted my trademark application ü•≤ This is the most costly thing I have done so far and trying to find a new product to fit under this name brand would also be a challenge.
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you <@536075832658231299> for your advice! I appreciate it!  I can see the risk of having just one supplier for your product. If anything goes wrong, I won‚Äôt be having a backup supplier.

<@975774205658411068> Hey shifu, would you be able to provide me with your thoughts on my situation? If both of you and Han lean toward the latter, I will drop the product. 

Thank you for all your help
  - 2024-10-28 | (2) Sourcing Agents: I have reached out to Macy and Elinor last week to help me source a product that has FDA 501k clearance. Thus far, Macy has not been able to locate a supplier that can offer better deal that the one I have right now. Furthermore, Macy said no other supplier can provide similar product with the FDA 501k clearance as it is difficult to obtain the certification from the FDA.

My questions are:

1. Should I move forward with this product and order the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier?
2. If ‚Äúno‚Äù is the answer to the first question, what would be recommended for the next step? Should I move away from this product? 

Thank you for all your help! I hope to hear from you soon!
  - 2024-10-28 | Hi Shifu team,

I hope you all had a great weekend! üòÜ

I‚Äôm sending out this message to update you on my listing issue prior to placing a bulk order. I‚Äôm asking for advices on if I should go ahead and purchase the FDA 501(k) clearance from our supplier so I can test out the listing?

Recap: My product is an ‚ÄúAbdominal Electrical Muscle Stimulator Belt‚Äù that requires an FDA 501(k) certification to seller in the US and on Amazon. I have done extensive research on this matter and confirmed that I will need the FDA 501(k) in order to sell this product to the public as Amazon has categorized this product as a medical device. Up to now, I have resolved all the other problems on the dummy listing except for submitting the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier to Seller Support Central

(1) Negotiation with supplier for FDA 501(k) certification: In the beginning,  my suppler wanted 50% down payment of the bulk order in order for me to obtain the FDA 501(k) clearance number to test out my listing. After a few days of negotiation, I was able to bring the price down to 30% down payment for the bulk order (which is roughly $2,500), and the supplier will not take anything less than that for the FDA 501k number. Note: This supplier owns the pattern of a product that has been selling on Amazon by another Chinese seller, and the supplier has assured me that the other Chinese seller was able to submit the same FDA 501(k) clearance number and they are currently selling the product on Amazon.
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you so much <@1054411267340763216> <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you and have a blessed day!
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi Shifu team, would anyone be able to share the sourcing agent Macy that Shifu Justin talked about? I would like to see if they can help me with sourcing out a product! üôè
  - 2024-10-21 | I did. I‚Äôll continue to follow up with them daily
  - 2024-10-21 | In your experience, would it be worth it to continue with this product since they require a lot of paper work and certification? Thanks
  - 2024-10-21 | UPDATE: The new listing became inactive right when I submitted it. I‚Äôm reading up on the regulation on the FDA regarding Electrical Muscle Stimulator. They said that this device will require 501k certification from FDA. I will have to wait for Amazon to response and then will go from there.
  - 2024-10-21 | I will try to create another listing without using any sensitive wording again to see how it goes.
  - 2024-10-21 | Yes, I did try to stay away from sensitive wording and my dummy listing has been approved for over 4-6 weeks, but just 2 days ago, Amazon Seller Central just made my listing inactive. I talked to my supplier about this issue and how one of my competitor was able to have the listing posted since they had the same model as my product. She said they were approved as they submitted further clarification paperwork and also the 501K FDA certification fromthe supplier.
  - 2024-10-19 | Here is my product: EMS belt and arm bands
  - 2024-10-19 | They said my product is for medical professional use only. But not for the public. I believe that is not true that i was able to purchase them myself. Nevertheless, i have submitted an appeal with picture of the packaging and the manual as stated in here. However, my supplier would only send me their 501k number from the FDA for their product once I placed a bulk order, and every supplier has said the same thing to me. I will wait for Amazon to respond then negotiate with my supplier that i want to order from them but it‚Äôs unreasonable to place a bulk order since i cant even sell it on amazon. I‚Äôm considering offering to put down a 3-5% deposit as good faith for the 501k number from the FDA. Would you think this approach is appropriate? <@536075832658231299> thanks for helping!
  - 2024-10-19 | Actually nevermind, all of my dummy listings have gone inactive. I‚Äôll chat further with Amazon to see how I can have it resolved. Would you recommend going with services on Fiverr to help resolve this problem? Thanks
  - 2024-10-19 | Hi anh <@1054411267340763216> thank you for answering my question about the UPC code vs the FNSKU on the dummy listing. Even after I use the service on Fiverr to convert the dummy listing to the real listing, would Amazon potentially flag me for having the product still in the restricted category? üò¨
  - 2024-10-17 | I'm on it üòÑ
  - 2024-10-17 | And just now 1 hour later Amazon approved my brand ü•≥
  - 2024-10-17 | Quick update: My supplier finished the logo-embedded product early. Just submitted Brand Registry application! ‚úÖüôåüôå
  - 2024-10-15 | Such a productive call! Thank you Anh Minh! üôå
  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks anh Minh! Booked a session for tomorrow! üôå
  - 2024-10-13 | While I was waiting for the ball to roll, I have finished the following:
- Two customized manuals for my main product and my add-on product ‚úÖ
- Insert card ‚úÖ
- 2 E-books as free gift for customers to leave review! ‚úÖ
- Instagram and Facebook page for my brand ‚úÖ
- Website Domain ‚úÖ
- Facebook Many Chat Flow to ask for reviews ‚úÖ maybe I need to do one for IG as well since many of my friends are more active on IG? 

What other suggestions would the team recommend? 

I couldn‚Äôt thank you enough for the great content and support for the past two months. I learned a lot and still have a long way to go üôå
I owe you guys each a bowl of Pho when you come to San Jose hehe ü•≥
  - 2024-10-13 | My to do list:

- Final Pricing Sheet with Supplier: I‚Äôm currently working this as well as trying to as for further discount as everything is set in place for now. 
- Barebones Listing: After Brand Registry is done, I will work on Barebones Listing to grab the FNSKU code you place it on the final packaging box. 
- Schedule a call with anh <@1054411267340763216> to go over the details (the market, my offers, pricing sheet, the contract with my supplier) before I place a bulk order. 
- Listing Creation: after all the above is done, i‚Äôll reach out to Susan for Listing creation. <@1066465177140215928> Please let me know your pricing so I can prepare ahead of time üòÅ

Is this plan sounded to the team? üòÉ
<@1054411267340763216> I would love to have the contract template ao I can start preparing it if you can share that with me üòÅ
  - 2024-10-13 | Quick recap on what i have done up to date:

- By the end of last week, I have just received my final design for the packaging box and on my product from the designer 
- I sent the design to my supplier and they will start making a sample with my logo on it (which takes about a week or so) for me to apply for brand registry.
  - 2024-10-13 | Thank you <@1066465177140215928> and <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out to me üòÅ I just finished work and heading into church now! I will update you shortly later about my current progress! üôå

1. Moving forward, I need to submit the Product Research Tracking Sheet or Product Research Homework via airtable? I am quite confused.

2. The top AMZ with highest 1,342 counts is a AMZ resale, but there is also another AMZ seller in the middle not doing good sales. I thought it might be good.

2. As long as the top revenue sellers are from CN and US sellers are in between, it should be ok?

  - 2024-11-27 | Thank you Minh, will try that. I've been talking to Macy and we're also speculating it may be because of FDA 510k preapproval number requirements for my product

  - 2024-11-21 | 1. Follow up with Safety Data sheet from Macy for the built in battery for Amazon as last step for dummy listing
2. Continue listening to rich dad poor dad
  - 2024-11-19 | 1. Follow up with Macy
2. Complete Amazon Seller verification / do dummy listing
  - 2024-11-19 | Top 2:
1. Follow up with suppliers on Alibaba.
2. Reach out to Macy
  - 2024-12-13 | I've gotten back in the groove with PR and feel like all the experience I had sourcing with suppliers & Macy's was very helpful in giving me a more holistic reality on the process. My main struggle is maintaining my motivation and not letting these be setbacks and use it more as learning experiences.
  - 2024-12-13 | I'm back to PR for the third time now. The first 2 instances I had my products approved, the items proved too difficult of markets to enter / source.

  - 2024-12-09 | Very excited about this! Hoping I will make it to this event! ‚ù§Ô∏è
  - 2024-11-19 | Thank you. With the window time is it when the goods arrive at port? Or the warehouse?? Because two out of the rest have gotten to port but still has to go through customs beforehand
  - 2024-11-18 | 
  - 2024-11-18 | Am I looking at this wrong??
  - 2024-11-18 | I‚Äôm a bit worried because the ETA my freight forwarder gave me isn‚Äôt exactly accurate with time of arrival. One should‚Äôve arrived already by tomorrow but it hasn‚Äôt yet and my window was set till the 19th only..
  - 2024-11-14 | I‚Äôm assuming she could use the reference ID here?
  - 2024-11-14 | 
  - 2024-11-14 | Where exactly can I find my reference ID??
  - 2024-11-14 | She‚Äôs saying one package got to port already and needs the reference ID to make an appointment with  AMZ warehouse.
  - 2024-11-13 | Ok, thanks!
  - 2024-11-13 | Yes, I believe so.
  - 2024-11-13 | Is the reference and shipment ID different?
  - 2024-11-13 | Correct
  - 2024-11-13 | She was saying how my tracking number for the shipment was incorrect
  - 2024-11-13 | Yeah, she was asking for reference ID
  - 2024-11-13 | I am confused. Because I did sea shipping. I was not given a tracking #. I ended up using random numbers for it.
  - 2024-11-13 | Is it because when I input the tracking # I just used a series of random numbers that‚Äôs why when she checked it was wrong.
  - 2024-11-13 | My freight forwarder told me that the shipping # is wrong for the one warehouse. Is ghat something I would just fix on my side??
  - 2024-10-30 | Thank you <@308107877493768193> ! It worked for me!
  - 2024-10-30 | The tracking Id should be at least 8 characters long correct?
  - 2024-10-30 | I tried inputting random numbers and letters and it‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs not recognized.
  - 2024-10-29 | What would I put as the tracking ID if that‚Äôs the case?
  - 2024-10-29 | Yes it‚Äôs sea shipping
  - 2024-10-29 | My freight forwarder should be the one providing me with the tracking ID correct? She seems to not understand and have been giving me the FBA ID instead.
  - 2024-10-29 | Was I given the wrong information?
  - 2024-10-29 | VGT2: JCR FBA18HVMPPP9  
AVP1: JCRFBA18HVPO42S  
RDU2:  JCRFBA18HVC8NJJ 
IAH3:   JCRFBA18HVOPCOW5 
RMN3:  JCRFBA18HVHJ785Ôºå


I was given this as the tracking ID?? But it‚Äôs showing on my side that is the Amazon fba box label # not tracking ID?
  - 2024-10-16 | I'm doing all sea shipping. She was able to give me a better offer. Thanks!
  - 2024-10-16 | She was able to offer me $583 for shipping fee. Then Macy offered $125 for inspection fee. Does that sound like a reasonable price?
  - 2024-10-16 | My supplier showed me this example
  - 2024-10-16 | I saw one video , labels for shipper but doesn‚Äôt show where exactly I can go to create the label for it.
  - 2024-10-16 | Where can I get the inner box barcode label? Is there a video showing that?
  - 2024-10-15 | Okay cool. I‚Äôll wait to see what she says. Thanks!
  - 2024-10-15 | So I would just compare this with Macy and if she is able to offer inspection at a lower price I‚Äôll go with her?
  - 2024-10-15 | Just to confirm. Where it says inspection would be the total cost for inspection correct?
  - 2024-10-15 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | So then it would be a total of 10 boxes since I am doing 200 units for my first batch correct?
  - 2024-10-14 | I‚Äôm wondering if I input it correctly?
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | This is what my supplier gave me. I am a bit confused on how to input the carton of units.
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you guys!!
  - 2024-10-14 | Is there a video showing which warehouse I should be sending my products to?? I remember seeing somewhere try to send to two different warehouses??
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you!
  - 2024-10-14 | Also, since yall have experience which would save me more money. Would it be using her to do the inspection or alibaba inspection which would be the better option yall think?
  - 2024-10-14 | Macy was asking for checklist for inspection. Where can I get that?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you. I‚Äôll reach out to her!
  - 2024-10-13 | The shipping was quite pricey on supplier side so I will have the shipping agent help with as she will give me a better deal on it.
  - 2024-10-13 | My batch is ready. How do I go about inspection and who would I go to for that?
  - 2024-10-10 | Most of my friends I am asking for fbm review  are from NC. As long as they‚Äôve never used my WiFi it should be okay right? I‚Äôm wondering how much I can ask before it gets too much from the same state I‚Äôm living in..
  - 2024-10-10 | Okay, how can I schedule a call?
  - 2024-10-10 | Is there something I should be doing on the google sheet side that I'm missing??
  - 2024-10-10 | On my screen i have no options for lookup column nor lookup value? Why is that?
  - 2024-12-10 | 1.) Continue working on module lessons. 
2.) Reach out to influencers for unboxing videos.

  - 2024-12-13 | Yesterday's meeting turned out to be not only productive but also unexpectedly fun! Some participants were so funny and positive that it was impossible to imagine this just from chatting with them online. The evening brought me a lot of positive emotions and a great boost of inspiration.

This meeting showed how different we all are, yet how amazing each of us is. We truly need each other's support, and this makes us a strong team. It‚Äôs so rewarding to be part of a group where people willingly give their time, share their experiences and insights. This is especially important for building strong partnerships and feeling like part of something greater.

These values lie at the heart of Shifu Academy. The academy is built on a solid foundation, inspiring us with the personal examples of its leaders ‚Äî <@975774205658411068>  <@705204493620478032>  <@536075832658231299>  They teach us to respect one another, support each other in challenging moments, celebrate victories together, and stay by each other's side when doubts or setbacks arise.

Key discussion topics:

1. Promotion through social media.

How to boost sales using social media posts.

How to create videos in Canva.

How to collaborate with influencers via Fiverr and Amazon (for instance, by finding them on competitors‚Äô pages).

What you can and cannot do on Instagram to avoid getting your account banned.

2. Benefits of using Attribution Links.
These links help track influencer performance to identify who drives the most sales and who is worth continuing to work with. Additionally, Amazon offers a 10% bonus for every sale made through these links.

3. Buying Instagram followers.
We discussed the possibility of purchasing followers to improve the visual appeal of your page. This might be a cost-effective option if the goal is to create a good first impression of the account. If anyone is interested, I can request pricing details.

4. Personal experience.
This week, I noticed an increase in sales thanks to social media activity. While I don‚Äôt know the exact sources of these sales (as they came outside PPC advertising), it proved the importance of consistency. It‚Äôs not about creating perfect posts but about taking regular action. You need to consistently talk about your brand and products on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest.

Positive outcomes:

Using shoppable videos on Amazon has made my brand more visible, even through Google search results.

The system works! You just need to "start the engine" and keep fueling it.


Thanks to <@1213271303327453305>   for the idea of using shoppable videos. I‚Äôm happy to share a list of reliable influencers who are easy and effective to work with.

What I‚Äôd like to explore further:

I would love to deepen my knowledge in PPC and financial strategies to build a long-term and sustainable growth plan.
  - 2024-12-11 | Last weekend, I officially launched. Over the weekend, I managed to record my first sales. Analyzing the data, I noticed that these sales came not through PPC advertising but from advertising channels such as Instagram and YouTube.
PPC is gaining momentum in terms of clicks, consuming like a newborn baby, but has not generated any sales over the past three days.
I am continuing to work on social media advertising and focusing on gaining more FBM reviews. I also created a Front Store on Amazon to enhance the brand's appeal.
  - 2024-12-10 | That‚Äôs such a heartwarming story! ‚ù§Ô∏è Your family must have been so overjoyed to see you after such a long journey‚Äîwhat a beautiful surprise! It‚Äôs amazing how our loved ones can inspire us to push forward and achieve our goals. Wishing you and your family a wonderful holiday season filled with love and joy! üéÑ

  - 2024-12-06 | Meeting Report with Shifu <@975774205658411068> 

Purpose of the Meeting:
Discussion of the strategy for launching my product on Amazon and the pricing approach. Additionally, we focused on mindset and long-term goals. As <@975774205658411068>  said, "Don‚Äôt be greedy," which makes sense for setting the right goal for a sustainable long-term period.

Key Recommendations:

1. Focus on Sales Volume:
Lower the price at the start to increase sales, gather reviews, and improve organic rankings.

Operate at a breakeven point initially to build momentum, with a plan to increase the price and profitability later.

2. Tools and Strategies:
Actively use PPC and influencer marketing for promotion.
Leverage customer reviews to improve the product and its description. Based on recommendations and testing shoppable videos on Amazon from <@1213271303327453305> , I managed to find great influencerson Fivver. I can share a list of 5-star influencers privately, as well as one influencer who stole my product and is now on the blacklist.

3. What I Need to Learn:
Use Excel for profit calculations and forecasting. Numbers reveal the big picture, eliminating guesswork and calculation errors.
Conclusion:
A successful launch requires a focus on sales growth and reputation rather than immediate profitability. Pricing, customer focus, and analytics are the key elements of this strategy.

  - 2024-12-01 | These 7 months of work, with all their ups and downs, have taken all my strength and faith. At the same time, this journey has been a source of tremendous growth, big dreams, and ambitions. In just a week, I will finally launch my product, and I am looking forward to it with excitement, like the birth of a child.

I am deeply grateful to everyone who has been with me on this journey, supporting and inspiring me throughout these months.
<@975774205658411068> <@705204493620478032>  <@536075832658231299>  <@1066465177140215928>   <@1054411267340763216>  <@1213271303327453305>   <@247959041106509824>  <@308107877493768193> 

The goals are ambitious, and there is still a lot of work ahead‚Äîtasks to tackle with focus, practice, and determination. But with a team like Shifu, I am confident that everything is possible!

I have taken a week off to wrap up unfinished tasks and recharge before the launch of my product on Amazon and the intensive PPC work. Right now, I am mentally recharging by doing things that relax me, like car racing and shooting practice.

Despite being on a break, I am always connected to the Academy to stay updated on all events, communicate with the team, and continue learning.

On Monday, I‚Äôll return to my work routine, ready to take on new challenges and achieve even greater victories. Thank you all for your support!

  - 2024-12-06 | Meeting Report with Shifu <@975774205658411068> 

Purpose of the Meeting:
Discussion of the strategy for launching my product on Amazon and the pricing approach. Additionally, we focused on mindset and long-term goals. As <@975774205658411068>  said, "Don‚Äôt be greedy," which makes sense for setting the right goal for a sustainable long-term period.

Key Recommendations:

1. Focus on Sales Volume:
Lower the price at the start to increase sales, gather reviews, and improve organic rankings.

Operate at a breakeven point initially to build momentum, with a plan to increase the price and profitability later.

2. Tools and Strategies:
Actively use PPC and influencer marketing for promotion.
Leverage customer reviews to improve the product and its description. Based on recommendations and testing shoppable videos on Amazon from <@1213271303327453305> , I managed to find great influencerson Fivver. I can share a list of 5-star influencers privately, as well as one influencer who stole my product and is now on the blacklist.

3. What I Need to Learn:
Use Excel for profit calculations and forecasting. Numbers reveal the big picture, eliminating guesswork and calculation errors.
Conclusion:
A successful launch requires a focus on sales growth and reputation rather than immediate profitability. Pricing, customer focus, and analytics are the key elements of this strategy.

  - 2024-12-01 | These 7 months of work, with all their ups and downs, have taken all my strength and faith. At the same time, this journey has been a source of tremendous growth, big dreams, and ambitions. In just a week, I will finally launch my product, and I am looking forward to it with excitement, like the birth of a child.

I am deeply grateful to everyone who has been with me on this journey, supporting and inspiring me throughout these months.
<@975774205658411068> <@705204493620478032>  <@536075832658231299>  <@1066465177140215928>   <@1054411267340763216>  <@1213271303327453305>   <@247959041106509824>  <@308107877493768193> 

The goals are ambitious, and there is still a lot of work ahead‚Äîtasks to tackle with focus, practice, and determination. But with a team like Shifu, I am confident that everything is possible!

I have taken a week off to wrap up unfinished tasks and recharge before the launch of my product on Amazon and the intensive PPC work. Right now, I am mentally recharging by doing things that relax me, like car racing and shooting practice.

Despite being on a break, I am always connected to the Academy to stay updated on all events, communicate with the team, and continue learning.

On Monday, I‚Äôll return to my work routine, ready to take on new challenges and achieve even greater victories. Thank you all for your support!

  - 2024-12-10 | Today's Monday Mindset session with Shifu Charlie was truly transformative. We focused on envisioning who we want to become in 2025, setting clear goals, taking action, writing them down, and prioritizing what truly matters‚Äîeliminating distractions and keeping only the most important things and people in our lives.

For me, it‚Äôs about more than just setting goals. It‚Äôs about reflection‚Äîtaking time to understand who I am and who I want to become. It‚Äôs about maintaining focus amidst chaos, learning to stay calm, and striving to become the best version of myself. I know my transformation depends entirely on me.

I need to confront my fears and silence the dark voice inside that holds me back. It‚Äôs a question of identity: Who am I? Am I comfortable being uncomfortable? The honest answer is no, not yet‚Äîbut that‚Äôs something I must change. My goal for 2025 is to embrace discomfort and grow through it, building everyday discipline in the process.

I aim to sleep 7‚Äì8 hours each night, take care of my body and mind, and learn to approach challenges with a calm, composed, and strategic mindset. Who do I want to be in 2025? A disciplined, resilient, and focused individual capable of handling anything that comes my way‚Äîlearning to stay cool under pressure while pursuing my goals. This journey of transformation starts now.

1. Go to the Help Section:
In your Amazon Seller Central account, open the Help tab.
2. Find the Get Help and Resources Section.
3. Why Not Open a Case:
Opening a case can take too long and delay the resolution. Instead, it‚Äôs more effective to call Amazon Support directly.
4. How to Prepare for the Call:

Identify the issue: For example, specify Issue with Asset for Premium A Plus.

Provide the ASIN for the product in question.

Prepare your phone number for the callback.
5. Steps to Make the Call:

Click Call me now and make sure you are near your phone.
Be ready to answer the call and explain the issue in detail.
6. Specifics of Calling Amazon Support:
In some cases, it might take multiple calls as the first consultant might not be qualified to resolve the issue.

If the consultant says they cannot help, thank them politely, hang up, and repeat the process by submitting the form again.

7. My Experience Resolving the Issue:
I had to make calls for about 4-5 hours and speak to over 15 different people before reaching the right specialist.
The specialist immediately filled out the form from their side, and within a few hours, my listing had access to Premium A Plus.
8. Advice:
Don‚Äôt give up after the first attempt. Keep calling until you reach a consultant who can assist.
Emphasize that Premium A Plus access must be updated directly on Amazon‚Äôs end.

Happy Thanksgiving! üçÇ Today, I want to sincerely thank each of you for your hard work, wisdom, and incredible support that have made my growth in our Academy possible.

Each of you is special in your own way, and your willingness to help, even in the most challenging situations, helps me feel that I am not alone.

For the past seven months, I have not told my family about what I‚Äôve been working on. This entire journey has been my personal decision and adventure. Being a part of our Academy has been a tremendous source of support, inspiration, and faith that I am on the right path.

You have given me confidence, surrounded me with understanding, and created an atmosphere where I can learn and grow. Thank you for everything you do!

May the Lord abundantly bless you and your families, filling your hearts with peace, joy, and gratitude. May all your dreams and prayers be heard, and may your lives shine brightly as a source of light, inspiration, and kindness for those around you. I wish you strong faith, love, and countless blessings.

With love,
Olesia Hall

  - 2024-12-11 | During the lesson, I can create a front store live on Zoom for one student. For this, I need the listing photos in advance, which should be prepared according to the template parameters. If you‚Äôd like me to create a front store for your product, please message me and send the photos beforehand. This is important so I can adjust the images to the correct sizes and we don‚Äôt waste time on this during the live session.
  - 2024-12-11 | I can share how build Front Store on Listing,  if someone  interested that. And just show some strategies how works with Shoppoble Influencers on Fivver and share my personal experience and tips.

  - 2024-12-10 | Thank you all! My heart is full! I haven‚Äôt seen them for a year and I feel very blessed to spend this holiday season with my family! Have a great week ahead shifu family! ‚ù§Ô∏è
  - 2024-12-10 | Surprised my family that lives in Japan for this holiday season. The 13-hour flight was worth it when I saw their reactions after seeing me. ü•π

They are one of the reasons why I started this AMZ journey. They are my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù 

Hope everyone have a good holidays with your family and loved ones! ‚ù§Ô∏è
  - 2024-12-04 | I asked amz to send it back to me. Some of them still looks brand new and haven‚Äôt been used for some reason. I guess customer just bought it and changed their mind and decided to return it. (But still shows as unfulfillable in your seller account)

I sold 4 units at FBM price by combining some of the add ons and main unit.
  - 2024-12-02 | That‚Äôs good! I thought it‚Äôs just a lost unit and no reimbursement haha. I did get reimbursement for 1 of the unit that customer did not return. Thank you brother!
  - 2024-12-02 | If it says "return not expected" does this mean the customer did not return the product to amazon and they have been refunded as well?
  - 2024-11-15 | I had the stock with me. I asked AMZ to send it back to me so I can close my listing. Feels weird to pack your own product and send it to customer hahaha. It was my first time lol.
  - 2024-11-15 | this happened to me too. I left my FBM open for FBM  F&F reviews and also because I have 2 units left from my 1st batch which I withdraw from AMZ warehouse. Then 2 random buyers bought those 2 units for FBM price. Just hoping that they are not hijackers lol
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Shifu, just to clarify. Is it okay to not do the storefront? And for your question, I did enroll for brand registry through suggested IP accelerator on amazon. üôÇ
  - 2024-11-15 | I just realized after watching Wed class, I don't have a storefront yet. Can someone teach me how to do it? Or is there any video/module that explains how to do it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Thanka shifu. I had it sorted out. I called paypal.
  - 2024-11-13 | I helped with fbm purchase with one of the mentees and she paid me via paypal.  I received the payment but I also got this email about holding the payment. 

It was recognized as a ‚Äúbusiness payment‚Äù to me and is asking me to put my tax ID on my paypal account. Should I just put my EIN?

My main concern is, this is not related with my business. Will this affect me during tax audits?

Thank you.

  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-11-15 | If I am still out of stock. Can I skip this homework for now and just do it once I have my 2nd batch?
  - 2024-10-28 | Got it. Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-10-28 | I did. Also, ACOS there says 7k+ Whereas, when I use campaign manager from amazon seller account, it is only 5k+.. (after I filter the date range from launch date to the day I closed my listing)
  - 2024-10-28 | So when computing it manually. Do we just deduct COGS and shipping from payout? (Payout minus COGS + shipping) ??
  - 2024-10-28 | But the payout from amazon.. Do they deduct already the ACOS, seller fees, refunds, and coupon discounts?
  - 2024-10-28 | I did, it says 4.2k in net profit. Shifu Justin just told me to do this method because sometimes, the sellerboard data might be inaccurate or not updated yet?
  - 2024-10-28 | Just 300 USD left... Is it negative 8k because I deduct the 15k from (amazon fees, coupon, ACOS, refunds) where it was deducted already before sending the direct deposit to me?
  - 2024-10-28 | Shifu Justin told me to do this to keep track on my profit/expenses. I feel like I am doing something wrong because my net profit is negative. Did I deduct too much? meaning = Amazon already deducted it from the payout and I deducted more during my computation? Thank you in advance for helping me figure out the math lol
  - 2024-10-27 | Yes, it was all set. I messaged Tom and he reminded Justin. He was just in another meeting. Thank you!
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi, Shifu Justin scheduled a meeting today with me at 1:30 but he is not on our zoom call yet. Can someone remind him? Or do we need to reschedule? thank you..
  - 2024-10-25 | Thank you Shifu. Can I go ahead and send FBA labels to my supplier?
  - 2024-10-25 | I did not update the warning mentioned because I don‚Äôt see any ‚Äúred‚Äù items that I need to update except for the listing price. After I updated the price, it is active now.

Should I go ahead and close it now? Or find the warning that they are telling?
  - 2024-10-25 | Now it says active, should I close the listing first while out of stock? shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-25 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> , I followed your video recording. My listing is back but it has some warnings/errors.. Please see the screenshot and let me know if there is anything I need to do?
  - 2024-10-25 | Okay. But the main reason I deleted my listing will be fixed? The fluid oz issue and the subscribe and save? 

Does it take 24 hours for my listing to be active again or more than 24 hours?
  - 2024-10-25 | Thank you for this. I will complete this tomorrow. When I submit this, is my listing back to normal? I don‚Äôt need to reupload the images? Videos? Bullet points?
  - 2024-10-25 | Oh no, time for an upgrade shifu. Maybe a urus like shifu justin haha
  - 2024-10-25 | No worries. Hope your car is doing good now.
  - 2024-10-24 | Shifu <@536075832658231299>  are we still meeting today or are you just going to send a recording?
  - 2024-10-24 | Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-10-24 | Shifu <@536075832658231299>  I will just send it here, there is a lot to screenshot on template tab and I might miss something. If you can make it tomorrow, is it the same time 5pm EST?
  - 2024-10-23 | Will send it to you once I get home. Thank you!
  - 2024-10-23 | Let me know what day works for you.
  - 2024-10-23 | shifu <@536075832658231299>  My excel is now working.
  - 2024-10-23 | yes
  - 2024-10-23 | got it. I can wait. No worries. üôÇ
  - 2024-10-23 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> can you send the link for our 1on1 today?
  - 2024-10-21 | It is for fixing my listing. Correcting the "Fl oz" for unit count type because it confuses some of the customers thinking it is a liquid product. Also removing the subscribe and save option because this option seems for a product that needs replenishment every month like a liquid product..
  - 2024-10-21 | October 23rd? 5pm EST?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you shifu. Is there like a tracking number that we can monitor?
  - 2024-10-14 | They will just ship it to me?
  - 2024-10-14 | Is it this one shifu? Then just click review?
  - 2024-10-14 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> , now it is showing up. How do I request withdrawals to send the units back to my address?
  - 2024-10-14 | Okay, I closed the listing. I will wait for a few minutes/hours as the "stranded inventory" is still not showing up so far.
  - 2024-10-14 | Sorry shifu, can you further explain? 

Based from my understanding. Close the listing and ask amazon to send the units back to me? I am US based by the way.
  - 2024-10-14 | Or maybe, I can just save it for mcf orders if a customer requests a new unit? In case 1 unit is defective‚Ä¶
  - 2024-10-14 | Not until January.. they just started production a week ago. 

Should I close it still?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you. After I sold this 2 unit. Should I go ahead and close it again?
  - 2024-10-14 | I reopened it today. They just sent me an email today about that 2 units. Is it correct that I reopened it?
  - 2024-10-14 | Now it's saying I have 2 units available?
  - 2024-10-14 | Good morning.

Can someone help me with this? I‚Äôm pretty sure I sold out but wondering why it says stranded. Did I close my listing too early? Do I need to reactivate it? When I closed the listing before it says ‚Äú0‚Äù available but there are still some units under ‚ÄúFC processing‚Äù
  - 2024-10-11 | Okay. I will tell them about the FBA label. But FNSKU, I can give them the old one and stick it on each unit packaging already?
  - 2024-10-11 | Not yet, they just want to get it to avoid delays. That's what they told me. But FBA labels are just outside of the cartons right?
  - 2024-10-11 | Okay, I will tell them to use the same FSNKU. What about the shipping label? Can I create one already or should I wait after our call?
  - 2024-10-11 | Hi shifu, just to make sure the only available dates are 10/21-10/24 right?
  - 2024-10-11 | Just tell them use the same FSNKU code? Will it be the same if I change my product title? Me and susan were trying to change it pre-launched but amazon is giving us an error.
  - 2024-11-07 | 1. Send FBA label to supplier 2. Watch class recording for Wed

  - 2024-12-05 | I hope this message finds you all well. I want to sincerely apologize for my delayed responses. The past few weeks have been quite busy with work, and on top of that, my wife and I had a series of hospital follow-ups. Thankfully, everything is going well, and I‚Äôm thrilled to share some wonderful news, we welcomed our baby into the world earlier than expected! While we were preparing for a December 20th due date, our little one arrived on the 2nd, and we were released from the hospital just yesterday.
This new chapter in my life has brought a renewed sense of motivation. With my growing family, I‚Äôm inspired to cherish every moment and strive for greater things. Thank you all for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate it. Let‚Äôs continue moving forward together! üôèüí™

  - 2024-04-21 | He, Sir <@1054411267340763216> do you have a copy of like a product proposal or list for the supplier where it has customization, logo and packaging? Thanks!
  - 2024-11-04 | Oh I already filed shifu, its the the quarterly use and sales tax. Thank you!
  - 2024-10-30 | Anybody from Caifornians have filed the use and sales tax quarterly? I have questions. Thanks!
  - 2024-04-24 | Or I will just call my registered agent to verify on this. But I guess I would still receive same answer which is it‚Äôs up to me. Lol
  - 2024-04-24 | To prevent from conflicting information as I am about to set up my Amazon US and will ask for business address.
  - 2024-04-24 | Do you use your residential address as your business address? Yes, I watched the video but I think it was not covered or tackled. This is for the uniformity of the addresses
  - 2024-08-23 | Oh I have not done launching call but I already launch my campaign for Sept 1
  - 2024-08-15 | Hello Sir <@536075832658231299> are we be able to have a copy of the PPC big picture you made like a mind map just to make Im on the right track before launching. Thanks
  - 2024-08-15 | Okay thanks sir <@536075832658231299>

  - 2024-12-04 | Thank you! Even if I have different variations?
  - 2024-12-04 | When you are purchasing upc codes from GS1, do you need an individual barcode for EACH piece of inventory? It looks like if I need 100 codes it‚Äôs cost hundreds of dollars? Is this correct?
  - 2024-12-05 | Do I have to have a separate listing of the same product for FBM? I would like to be able to ship a few myself to get reviews?
  - 2024-11-12 | Thank you so much!
  - 2024-11-12 | <@308107877493768193> thank you. That helps out. So I would need my supplier to go ahead and separate  to ship to different locations?
  - 2024-11-12 | <@536075832658231299> you had mentioned that one box should not be over 50 pounds. Is that correct? Also, it‚Äôs better to ship to 5 different warehouses so that it will speed up the process at the warehouse and also cost less? Is that right? Just want to make sure I understood correctly? üòÄ

  - 2024-12-13 | 
  - 2024-12-07 | I think it would be super valuable since some students come from out of state (and opportunity cost wise I will be missing 2 days of work just to attend  and I‚Äôm sure many other students will be in the same boat) to try and make it to this meeting if the master mind could have exclusive topics not covered in the course:

1) key note speakers of past mentee that have made it and maybe exited (sold their business) or Charlie come speak I love his Monday mindset class 
2) explaining Walmart, Etsy, TikTok, Shopify, eBay, instagram shop, google ads  in particular the fee, the marketing, pros and cons of selling on those platforms 
3) explaining outside Amazon warehouse into 3PL and which company are recommend and the strategy behind that 
4) Amazon affiliate program and attribution program 
5) Amazon shoppable and Amazon influencer videos 

I think these topics for me at least would be worth while to talk about. Not sure what past master mind meet up entitled but I‚Äôm assuming it will be advancing your listing post launch. <@1054411267340763216> <@975774205658411068> <@705204493620478032> Let us know if this is possible.

  - 2024-08-09 | does PPC work like an auction? Where if you bid more conservatively like suggested $3 you do $2 the other guy bids $3, $3.5, $4 will be above you on the key word search? Also running a ppc campaign does it shows up as sponsor right? the ones that show up without sponsor ranked organically?
  - 2024-08-08 | Got it makes sense thanks for explaining!
  - 2024-08-08 | What does CPR stand for? I googled it it says cerebro product rank so then the lower the better right? But then <@536075832658231299> PPC video says it stands for "the number of sales in the last 8 days" so then that means the higher the number the better??

  - 2024-12-12 | 1. Food is medicine. Health is wealth.  You do not need alcohol to be social.   
2. When you have a problem, do not dwell on the negative for too long. Figure out a solution and move forward to the next step.  
3.  Progress over perfection. Stop trying to be perfect in the beginning. Just start and then continue to optimize.

  - 2024-12-10 | Here are some great motivations I noted from today's class: 
1. Discipline = understanding your true desire and aligning your actions with who you want to become. 
2. Declutter you desk, workspace, apps, life, etc. 
3. Every action you take is a vote for you to win. 
4. Who do you want to become in 2025?
5. Be clear about what you want.

  - 2024-11-20 | Hi <@536075832658231299>, when should I expect an update on the ppc assistant?
  - 2024-11-18 | Hi Han, I redropped 1 sheet per file. Thank you.
  - 2024-11-18 | I just resubmitted on PPC assistant again. Apologies on the confusion.

  - 2024-11-12 | Hi. In my first order, I had 5 shipments. One shipment did not have a tracking number and was delivered via POD+ISA, so now my current defect rate is at 20%. I got a defect type for not inputting a tracking number. Should I submit the dispute and select the option in the screenshot?

  - 2024-11-08 | 
  - 2024-11-08 | Hi Han, I noticed my items for the variation title doesn't match my parent variation, so I attempted to edit the item name and get this error attached.  Do I need to do it another way to update the item name?

  - 2024-12-07 | I‚Äôd like to have a new business address in Florida for convenience, to pick up packages  or private mail in future

If the LLC can transferred to Florida without dissolving it might be easier, only need to comply with Florida‚Äôs sales tax laws, since it would be under a single state
  - 2024-12-07 | Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone here has experience moving your LLC from 1 state to another and could share some simple tips.

Would it be better to dissolve my LLC in Illinois, where it‚Äôs registered, and start a new LLC in Florida?

Or should I register as a foreign LLC in Florida? I‚Äôm concerned about the cost of maintaining in 2 states thankss

Thank u

  - 2024-10-13 | Means thoes keyword have no impression
  - 2024-10-13 | I just submitted a request for PPC assistance, and after reviewing the report for the last 15 days, I noticed that most of my keywords are not performing well. Only 2 or 3 keywords and product targeting have high impressions and a few sales since the launch. % ACOS is really high. Should I target new keywords? Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  - 2024-10-13 | Alright I see. Thank you

  - 2024-10-30 | Okay brother, thank you
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> , 

Sorry Idk why I didn‚Äôt get this notification but yea so I filed my trademark using a third party service like how I filed my llc through legalzoom. Just to save money and just having small issues back and forth. Overall just been slow process for me because I had to await samples and now feedbacks from friends/family. Once my trademark is straightened up, I will complete my brand registry
  - 2024-10-17 | Great, thanks
  - 2024-12-10 | 1. Finalize with what to bundle with product 

2. Complete brand registry

  - 2024-03-05 | Yea I thought about it too. But decided that it was a bit overkill so I went ahead with the quick USPTO search
  - 2024-02-15 | Probably just cause LegalZoom is kinda sketchy with how they present their services. A lot of their add ons when intiailly signed up for an LLC could be done for free or optional lol
But this sounds like one of those services that's worth spending money on to save you time. good suggestion, <@1112578451816321157>

  - 2024-11-11 | My Name is Jenn O. and I am a photographer, videographer and run a photobooth business. I live in Los Angeles CA and my hobbies are going to music festivals, being outdoors in nature, trying new things, exploring food and traveling the world. 

My vision for my life is to be have financial stability and ultimately be able to experience life with the people I love since I never had that growing up. My current position in the service industry is taking away the opportunity for me to make money while I‚Äôm not there. I‚Äôm committed to diversifying my income so that I can provide stability for my future. Also I want to be able to provide stability and peace for my mother who is getting old in korea and I want to be able to give back 10 folds. 

My goals in the next 1-2 years is to have my first amazon shop set up or even two! Also to move my home office for photography into studio/warehouse in 1 year. Also another big goal in 2 years is to have saved enough money for a house.

What I would tell my future self when I am successful and looking back at my journey is that I am proud of you for sticking to your commitment and vision. I‚Äôm proud that you stayed consistent, trusted the process and made the necessary sacrifices to be where you are today.

What I would tell myself when I am encountering difficulty so I don‚Äôt give up is that it‚Äôs okay to not know everything and that there is support around me if I ask. Also not to regret letting more time pass by cause my younger self deserve to have what I‚Äôve always envisioned for me!
  - 2024-11-28 | Hey guys! Happy thanksgiving! 
A few of my friends and I are putting a toy drive for the foster kids in LA. Even a football or small contribution goes a long way to possibly spark some inspiration to these kids! There‚Äôs strength in numbers so we would love any support! 

The whole goal is to pay it forward and give away what we want for ourselves. ü§ç

I know some of you aren‚Äôt in LA but we plan to take advantage of the Black Friday sale and you can ship it to me and I‚Äôll make sure it gets delivered! 

We will be collecting up until Dec 8th. I‚Äôll post up all the photos from our toy drives  for you guys! If you are interested pls reach out and I‚Äôll give you more information!!!  Thanks again <@975774205658411068> for just giving us the platform to win in all aspects in our lives!

  - 2024-12-09 | Just had a call with <@536075832658231299> ‚Äîbest call ever!üò≠  I've been contacting Amazon and struggling with a listing for months, and he solved it in a second. I feel like he solved half of my problems; I feel so relieved now. He should be an Amazon supervisorüòÜ . I wish I had reached out to him earlier. It's always good to learn new things from others.
  - 2024-12-09 | <@931213533134344222> I know your product is consider as treatment üòÇ . <@613172337470341150> not sure about yours
  - 2024-12-09 | I posted on the community before but will repost it here. Hope it helps.You can try, but there's no guarantee. If you don‚Äôt have FDA approval (anything consider as treatment or medical, theraphy). There will be a chance Amazon will flagged the listing as a laser product. Hiring someone on Fiverr to write the product description, bullet points, and anything related to the product. Upload the listing to see if Amazon flags it. Keep repeating until the listing is approved.
  - 2024-12-09 | Then don't worry about itüòÇ
  - 2024-12-09 | You also have FDA product?

  - 2024-12-10 | I am not sure. Because they was using mh listing images and there is nothing we can do about it. Right <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-12-10 | Good question, same things happened to me. Looking for an answer tooü§î
  - 2024-12-09 | Is there anything should we worry about if they are dropshipping?  Actually I had someone bought 25 and 18 units in the past.ü§î
  - 2024-12-09 | Does anyone work with a 3PL to handle repackaging return units? How much do they charge for repackaging and sending the units back to an Amazon warehouse? Is the pricing based on hourly rates, or does it depend on the size and weight of each unit? Any information would help a lot ü•∞ üôè
  - 2024-12-09 | Just put an estimated <@1225664394923348019>  for example if bulk order expected to arrive at amz warehouse around the 10th -20th just put 15th. Amz will automatically extend the receiving goods window by around two weeks, from the 15th to the 30th. You can always come back and change the delivery window later, so just input the estimated delivery date for now.
  - 2024-12-09 | You can use the shipping labels anytime <@1225664394923348019> . Just make sure your delivery windows estimated is correct
  - 2024-12-09 | I even put QR code in the manual user, offering different things to attract them üòÇ  Good luck <@1271018123725770762>
  - 2024-12-09 | Actually I have QR code for lifetime warranty and link to many chat printed inside the box. I been trying everything to get reviews from customers üòÇ I get the idea from other seller, they have sticker with QR code on the product. But I think this way is better.
  - 2024-12-04 | Can you share more 3PL in Cal or Dallas too üôèüèº
  - 2024-12-04 | so if you have 2 variation (size, color,etc) you will need 2 UPC codes <@1213261554535890944>
  - 2024-12-04 | No, each SKU will have 1 UPC code, so you only need 1 <@1213261554535890944>
  - 2024-12-02 | üò¨ oops let‚Äôs me watch it
  - 2024-12-02 | Yes as I know some bank doesn‚Äôt let do balance transfer but not all of them. Like some Chase cc doesn‚Äôt allow balance transfer. Check with them before apply üòÅ
  - 2024-12-02 | I have been doing it <@691122008930648136> <@1066465177140215928> so whenever they start charging interest -apply another cc the month before. Then do balance transfer and  merge credit line which also give you more space for next batch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  - 2024-11-13 | After creating an MCF order, Amz will provide the Order ID # . Save that number. Amz also send you another email afterward with the Order ID and tracking number.

  - 2024-12-11 | Nice <@931213533134344222>  I recall a story about 2 wolves. There is 2 wolves fighting inside of us. The black one and the white one. Which one will win? The one you feed üôèüèº
  - 2024-12-11 | 1. Don‚Äôt worry about what people say about you. When they say you‚Äôve changed, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt know how to say you‚Äôve grown.

2. You can‚Äôt wish for strong character and an easy life; each is the price of the other. What if what you‚Äôre going through isn‚Äôt hard? What if you‚Äôre just sensitive?

3. The magic you‚Äôre looking for is in the work you‚Äôre avoiding. 
Bonus- this one hit me really hard.
Consistency doesn‚Äôt guarantee you will be successful. But not being consistent will guarantee that you won‚Äôt reach successüôèüèº

  - 2024-11-16 | Thank you <@975774205658411068>  for sharing informationüôÇ  I would recommend Larry for this service, since I think doing FBM orders for reviews can be risky. Some of you may not want to leak the product, or you might not have family members live in US to help out. Many of the mentee accounts here have a long buying history, but they rarely leave product reviews, and start leaving reviews for new accounts, which Amazon could track it (as inappropriate). Asking them for help could increase the chances of your listing getting blocked, or even their account being flagged, which could also affect our selling account. However, keep in mind that this service is a bit pricey since you have to pay everything upfront.

  - 2024-12-04 | Hi all, I want to share some tips part 2üòÇ 

If you've had your listing done but don't like it, or if you want to change it to match a seasonal theme on a short budget, or if you're having trouble finding a good listing agent to redo it, here's what I find helpful.

Ask your listing agent for all the product photos and 3D images (or any other images) with a white background.
(You can use a tool like PhotoRoom to remove the background, but for me, it's not ideal since it doesn't allow me to control what to keep or remove from the image.- still learning how to use it correctly)

Use Canva to edit or change the theme of your listing images, and/or RESIZE them for premium A+ content.

This way, you can save money and customize your listing exactly how you want it. Of course, you can't change the entire listing this way, but it can help you improve and update certain parts without breaking the bank. This is just an example but at least make listing image look more appealing
  - 2024-12-04 | For anyone newly launching a product on H10, I find the Xray Keywords feature extremely helpful. You can run Xray Keywords on competitor listings to find performance keywords that are generating sales for the product. By adding these keywords to your PPC campaigns, you can leverage competitor data to boost sales of your own product.
If you have the H10 Diamond Plan, you can also see the competitor's bids for each keyword, giving you even more insights to optimize your PPC strategy.

I am having trouble creating a variation and couldn't do it the traditional way. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they all advised me to create the variation through feeds. Has anyone done this before and can walk me through it, please? I'm not sure I understand what they're talking about.
  - 2024-11-19 | Thank you <@1059659092475531444> I will try to catch up this weekü•≤

  - 2024-11-11 | And about the negotiation <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-11 | üôèüèºüò¨
  - 2024-11-11 | And about storing goods in a 3PL warehouse and then shipping them to a nearby Amazon warehouse. I don‚Äôt understand if we order too much for small business like me. I can't generate enough cash flow because we have too much inventory in the warehouse. Also, is there really a significant difference between storing goods in an Amazon warehouse and a 3PL? Usually, we‚Äôre still able to sell those batches within three months to avoid extra fees on top? And those fees are tax write off. And during the holidays, even when we send inventory to Amazon, it still takes a while for them to receive it. So, what‚Äôs the benefit of storing in a warehouse and shipping to Amazon later?
  - 2024-11-11 | Is it normal to keep negotiating the price? I always negotiate the price down every time I place an order. I still want to maintain a good relationship and make sure I‚Äôm doing it right, at least ensuring they feel comfortable. When should we stop negotiating the price with the manufacturer?
  - 2024-11-11 | Hi everyone, can you please give me some advice? I‚Äôm thinking of switching to FBM to reduce fees, but I‚Äôm concerned that it means we‚Äôll have to handle all customer service and returns, which would require hiring someone to be available 24/7 to manage these issues. I still prefer FBA since it‚Äôs managed by Amazon and includes Prime shipping, but is there a way to reduce the fees? Or should we consider a mix of FBM and FBA? Also, when we start selling on other platforms in the future, we‚Äôll still use a 3PL for storage and shipping, right?
  - 2024-11-08 | Sorry Jamie and everyone I just get busy around holiday time and totally lost track of time. It‚Äôs just too much on my hands right now. I can‚Äôt even join any classes during the week. But I will try my best to catch up and turn in hw on time ü•≤
  - 2024-11-07 | Im thinking if you can‚Äôt even sell during holiday and it will be harder to sell after it
  - 2024-11-07 | Because it‚Äôs holiday season so i thought it would be a great time to sell and test the product. But that‚Äôs one really frustrating ü•≤
  - 2024-11-07 | Actually another product ü•π I launched 2 weeks ago the one flagged by amz remember
  - 2024-11-05 | <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>  ü•πI‚Äôm also having trouble with my product in a high competitive market. I've tested a bunch of kws, tried lowering the price, and even raised bids (which were already high), but I still can't get impressions. Do you recommend any way to fix this?üòî
  - 2024-11-05 | I'll sort everything out in the document and send you a copy. I need to do more research and get ideas from other Shopify stores. Thank you so much for your advice, Susan.ü´∂

  - 2024-11-13 | When trying to change the Title of your listing, can you use the "copy listing" and then delete the old listing after its published? Or do you have to do the long way with creating a new listing from scratch/spreadsheet?

  - 2024-12-10 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-21 | I didn't wait so I can prepare for the first day of the sales tomorrow
  - 2024-11-20 | I tried and it still doesn't update the Title. I will try the delete and reupload spreadsheet method again after prime Week.
  - 2024-11-15 | Okay got it. Thank you
  - 2024-11-15 | Ah that was my mistake. I searched and used my original one.
  - 2024-11-15 | And you search your product right?
  - 2024-11-15 | This should be the spreadsheet that says ‚Äúadd a product that is already listed‚Äù?
  - 2024-11-15 | Okay I deleted it. I‚Äôll wait another 24 hours to redo it and upload a blank spreadsheet to see what red outline ones are needed
  - 2024-11-15 | I just went to inventory and somehow the spreadsheet created my listing. I still have the OLD title eventhough I uploaded a spreadsheet after 24 hours
  - 2024-11-15 | I am trying to upload the Spreadsheet and I have these 2 errors.
1. I put in my exact inventory. What would this require? or do I put 0?
2. Do I make a new SKU? I ran it with the SKU they provided, then I Ran another one with my old SKU. Both gave me these errors
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-13 | I see okay. I can do that
  - 2024-11-13 | okay. So delete first then reupload the spreadsheet? or vice versa?
  - 2024-11-13 | what about the current inventory that has the ASIN printed on them?
  - 2024-11-13 | this has to create a new ASIN?
  - 2024-11-13 | wouldn't it be a lot faster?
  - 2024-11-13 | curious to know why the "copy" listing doesnt work better?
  - 2024-11-13 | okay I will try that out
  - 2024-11-13 | correct
  - 2024-11-13 | or close it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Create a new one then delete the old one?
  - 2024-11-13 | no I dont have to
  - 2024-11-13 | and create a new listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | so I will update all the info and type it in
  - 2024-11-13 | but I didn't copy everything over. I just tried to refresh the current one
  - 2024-11-13 | I did it yesterday with the partial update
  - 2024-11-13 | Okay. I will do that
  - 2024-11-13 | Hmm so far out. Let me try to do it on my own first lol. So I can adjust it before this weekend
  - 2024-11-07 | I wasn‚Äôt able to attend his class yesterday so I didn‚Äôt get a chance to send anything in yet. 

I am still in the process of moving  some of my work schedules around for the weekly meeting
  - 2024-11-01 | Thank you! I‚Äôm glad to be back and in need of some help. I‚Äôm already working on some tips Justin has given me and seeing how that goes in the next couple of weeks

Loved today‚Äôs call with mentees. Really thankful for you all sharing useful tips for everyone.  I will have to start writing down my own tips so I can share them also.

My top goals for the week are 
1. Make 3 short videos and post on social media
2. Continue with 3 fbm sales 
3. Create shipping labels, appoint quality inspector and make sure everything is good for second batch
All for this week. 

Lastly, I can‚Äôt believe customers are still buying my product  I have been increasing 3$ every three days and I am getting the same number of sales as before but with a higher price tag. Maybe it‚Äôs because on my listing it‚Äôs showing last 20 units so it creates a sense of urgency on customers. Anyway, looking forward to selling out soon üî•
  - 2024-12-11 | December 11, 2024 
Last 19 units, increased price again and without ads. Surprised to say I am selling a few units but with profit finally  üò≠ üî•

It‚Äôs Wednesday and I have not received any organic reviews until today. Since running out of stocks I have to change my goals for now 
Goals of the week
1. Focus on fbm reviews and sales 
2. Continue creating short videos 
3. Settle trademark issues 

Also it‚Äôs good to ask your supplier for videos and photos so I can also leverage the ones they already have for my social media. Thankfully my supplier I  can feel they want to help me and see potential growth with me. So they are really willing to help me with what I needüöÄ
  - 2024-12-10 | December 10, 2024 

Same goals as always
1. 2-3 organic reviews 
2. 3-5 fbm sales 
3. One reel
  - 2024-12-09 | I know right , I was like is your product considered as needing fda ü§î
  - 2024-12-09 | Hahahaha ok ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠
  - 2024-12-09 | No
  - 2024-12-09 | I can‚Äôt afford for that to happen to me üò≠
  - 2024-12-09 | Chloe can you give me details on why it happened to you?
  - 2024-12-08 | December 8, 2024
Today it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day in my country, my siblings will usually buy flowers to all mothers in our family but I told them I didn‚Äôt want them and they can use that money to buy one bigger for my mom, they did exactly what we planned but later I was shocked to receive this snacks bouquet from them. It was a wholesome surprise, I loved it, so I am blessed to have such good hearted family ‚ù§Ô∏è I know most don‚Äôt celebrate Mother‚Äôs Day today but still Happy Mother‚Äôs Day to all mums here, all the sleepless nights, feeding, taking care of a little so they can have the best they deserve in this world, it‚Äôs all worth it ‚ù§Ô∏è

Working on second batch , next week production may be done. Arranging quality inspector and adding few more  things to look out for. 

From my goals I missed one fbm purchase, so my next week goals are as follow
1. 2-4 organic reviews 
2. 4 fbm sales (one more because I missed one this week)
3. At least one short video for social media
  - 2024-12-06 | I agree 100% üî•üôè
  - 2024-12-06 | December 5, 2024
On my last 40 units, will increase price again tomorrow and will pause most campaigns  except for lowest acos one. Already ordered second batch(supplier gave me 1.46$ off each product that‚Äôs almost 900$ I saved üôè, almost done with production. Sadly, won‚Äôt be able to sell for Christmasü•≤ currently working on my marketing strategy plan before launching second  batch and listening to the art of the deal by Donald trumpüëçüèª

My goals 
1. Got 3 organic reviews this week and it‚Äôs only Thursdayüî•
2. Have 2 fbm sales just need one more before the end of the week to reach the goal 
3. Posted one short video on all social medias

Also thankful for mom for giving me a strong body, this body that doesn‚Äôt get sick a lot and really enduring so I can still have energy to balance and do all the things that needs to be done.  Lastly., I am thankful for God for everything I have and pray for everyday.

In my country we don‚Äôt celebrate thanksgiving but I can guess it‚Äôs a day to celebrate all the things we are grateful for. As many here, I am grateful and blessed to be part of this fammunity, a lot of lovely people and great coaches. Also thankful for mom for giving me a strong body, this body that doesn‚Äôt get sick a lot and really enduring so I can still have energy to balance and do all the things that needs to be done.  Lastly., I am thankful for God for everything I have and pray for everyday. 

My top 3 goals for the week:
1. this week I got 3 organic reviews üëèüèªüëèüèª and continuing to provide customer service.
2. Got 2 fbm purchases, just need one more before the end of the week to reach my goal. Apart from the organic reviews, 2 more reviews from f&f
3. Posted 2 short videos on YouTube and other social medias 
4. I started PPC hw4 but I need to finish it for this weekü•≤

  - 2024-12-09 | I am currently texting with one and getting some details about it before making a decision
  - 2024-12-04 | Yes
  - 2024-12-04 | Ok I see thanks Engel. I think I will do just that
  - 2024-12-04 | Is it recommended to liquidate or dispatch unfulfillable orders ? Taking in consideration I am not from the states
  - 2024-12-04 | ok will do, Thank you
  - 2024-12-03 | yes, so i originally sold around 320 units (it was this number for like 2 weeks) now it changed to around 270 units. i just checked on shipments and there are no discrepancies
  - 2024-12-03 | How come I first had over 300 units sold then suddenly it dropped to around 270? Is there a reason to this ? If I sum the sold stock and all the unfulfillable, fc transfer , available stock doesn‚Äôt match the total amount I initially ordered ü§îü§î

  - 2024-11-22 | Ok ! Thank you
  - 2024-11-21 | this is for ppc practice 4
  - 2024-11-21 | <@536075832658231299> can you helpme with this highlighted example? the impressions are low but the clicks are high. My guess is to lower just a bit because the acos is still high but not so much because there is not much impressions
  - 2024-11-14 | üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªthank you
  - 2024-11-05 | Should we just take out this kw?
  - 2024-11-05 | And what if I already set bid to be 0.20, still not generation sales but spending 100+ , what should be we in this case ?
  - 2024-11-05 | <@536075832658231299> for example, if there is 30 clicks, no sales and the cpc Is lower than the suggested bid, why do we want to keep it the same ?
  - 2024-11-18 | Ok will work on that
  - 2024-11-18 | I am also trying to run another coupon with the new price of 99.99 by offering 5% discount, but the system won‚Äôt allow because now the price with coupon is 94.99 and they want it to be 92.14 because it was the lowest price with coupon before the change. Does this mean I cant put coupon unless I want to lower it to 92.14?
  - 2024-11-18 | Hello shifus, should I worry about the return rate ?
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok I will still analyze the ranking of kws
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok will do
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok
  - 2024-11-15 | 96.99
  - 2024-11-15 | I was thinking about this , maybe increasing to 99.99 first to test it out for a week. I am on my last 200 units and next batch will come on late December or beginning of January

  - 2024-12-11 | Glad to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts on it. I‚Äôm really not a fan of sketchy things like this. But I guess I gotta look at the bright side of things that are out of my control.
  - 2024-12-10 | Got it. I decided to just increase my B2B price and only offer a discount for higher quantities. I‚Äôll let them play their game since it‚Äôs helping me with ad-free sales lol.
  - 2024-12-10 | I‚Äôll look into making an eBay listing and sell it at my price. That should get rid of them. OR I drop ship my own listing at their price  üòà jk that‚Äôs dirty.
  - 2024-12-10 | Yeah my only concern was the lack of customer support. But hopefully they scan my QR code or send an email if there are issues.
  - 2024-12-10 | Thanks for the insight!
  - 2024-12-10 | Did anything bad come from it? I just found 5 different sellers on eBay lol.
  - 2024-12-10 | Welp I found the drop shipper on eBay lol. Selling 50% over my price. üò≥ The pros are they‚Äôre getting me ad-free sales. But what could be the cons of this?
  - 2024-12-09 | Ahh never thought about that possibility. No returns yet. They opted out of communications from sellers too... so I got it all documented and will watch out if they try to spam returns or do something else. 
I got the same question as Chloe though. ü§î
  - 2024-12-09 | I just received 8 separate orders from a business customer and was a bit concerned so I dove into my order history. I found 15 separate orders from the same customer in the last few days. 

Anyone experienced this before? Is this a new method of hijacking? I just reached out to them to see what they‚Äôre up to üò¨
  - 2024-12-08 | In short, just be cautious with the word free lol
  - 2024-12-08 | I give away a free e-book and have no problems. I just use the word ‚Äúincluded‚Äù instead. What violates their policy is a free gift for a review. So having the word ‚Äúfree‚Äù on there doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre in violation but it could raise a flag for investigation if it‚Äôs reported. But that‚Äôs when we would just modify our ManyChat to remove the ‚Äòreview for gift‚Äô portion.
  - 2024-12-08 | Hi Thuy! The printed QR code is a great idea that adds to a sleek design. Just be cautious with putting the ‚Äúfree gift‚Äù there since it would be harder to remove if reported as violating Amazon‚Äôs policy.
  - 2024-12-03 | Ah I see. So I looked through Amazon seller forums and from what I gathered, it could be that some orders may have been cancelled after ordering or payments from buyers didn‚Äôt go through resulting in cancellation. Which Amazon then adjusts the sales data accordingly.

However this doesn‚Äôt explain why your totals don‚Äôt match up to your original inventory count. So I‚Äôm not too sure about that part.
  - 2024-12-03 | Hi <@613172337470341150>, just to clarify, are you saying you already sold 300 units but now it says you sold 270 units? Or that you ordered 300 units and sold 270 so you‚Äôre missing 30 units?

You can see if there are any shipment discrepancies in the ‚ÄúManage FBM Shipments‚Äù tab. If there are any missing units, Amazon will reimburse you for the COGS. If they find the missing units later then they will revert the reimbursement.
  - 2024-12-02 | Hi Engel, yes, the customer doesn‚Äôt have to return the item and they still get refunded. But if they don‚Äôt return it, then after 60 days Amazon will reimburse you for it.
  - 2024-12-02 | Good thinking!
  - 2024-12-02 | I‚Äôve reached out to customers that return products just to try to avoid a bad review üòÖ

It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to message them to try and send them the missing part. Just be careful with asking them to change their review.
  - 2024-11-30 | Hi Thuyphuong. Include the #. It makes the address more accurate for our forwarder.

  - 2024-11-30 | Hi Thuyphuong. Include the #. It makes the address more accurate for our forwarder.
  - 2024-12-12 | 1. Things won‚Äôt always go as planned, so be willing to adapt to create a new plan.
2. Uncomfortable tasks are unavoidable when reaching for success. So take those on with a positive attitude.

  - 2024-01-22 | This is awesome, Chris! Keep sharing!
  - 2024-05-24 | Wow ü§Ø. It‚Äôs incredible how many layers of advertising this one idea runs through.
  - 2024-12-05 | Good morning brother, is this the in-person meetup or is this over zoom?
  - 2024-04-24 | Oh good! Sorry I‚Äôm late to the party haha.
  - 2024-04-24 | Hi Lowell, I used a UPS private mailbox address as my business address. Whichever address you decide to use, customers will see it.

  - 2024-12-04 | This is a response from my lawyers when I wanted to remove assigned search codes:

‚ÄúThere is a mechanism to delete design search codes. However, the deletion is a separate submission and a brief justification as to the request must be made under Trademark Office rules. The design search codes were selected by the Trademark Office. As reflected in the Official USPTO Notice of Design Search Code, ‚Äúassigning design search codes to your mark helps us [the USPTO] more effectively search our database for marks that may conflict with yours. Design search codes have no legal significance and will not appear on the registration certificate.‚Äù (Emphasis added.)
 
Given that the likelihood-of-confusion 2(d) search has already been conducted, the design search codes are now moot. However, if you would nonetheless like us to attempt to have them removed from the record, our quote would be $300. We ask that you provide us with the ‚Äújustification‚Äù for removing the design codes as required by the USPTO. (It seems to us that keeping the design search codes is beneficial to you, since it shows that the Examining Attorney conducted a broader, wider search when considering likelihood of confusion. But the decision of whether to proceed with their removal is yours.)‚Äù
  - 2024-12-04 | Woohoo! Congratulations! That means they‚Äôre processing your application and it‚Äôs moving towards publication.

As Han said, forward that to your ip lawyer so they can respond to the Office Action.
  - 2024-12-09 | Mhmm! Smart of you to think ahead though!
  - 2024-12-09 | After you sell over $10K Amazon will reach out to you and it‚Äôs a very simple process through their services.
  - 2024-11-27 | There is a benefit of sending to more locations though, in the off chance that any one of your shipments get stuck, you have other shipments that are still in transit. Hope that helps!
  - 2024-11-27 | In my experience, shipping to 3 locations in the West was the cheapest. Choosing 1 location pays Amazon more and Forwarder less. 5 locations pays Amazon less but Forwarder more.
3 was the sweet spot.
I recommend running the numbers for all the options though to see the comparison for your product.

Also, if you‚Äôre shipping to the West, truck delivery from port to Amazon is cheaper and faster than UPS.

  - 2024-12-11 | Yeah he DM‚Äôd me asking how much the premium membership cost. Awesome, I‚Äôll send that to him.
  - 2024-12-11 | Of course. Sounds good. I‚Äôll hold off on answering his question about membership pricing for now.
  - 2024-12-11 | 
  - 2024-12-11 | He‚Äôs the younger one of the two Khoa‚Äôs in the program.
  - 2024-12-11 | His last name isn‚Äôt shown on his username. But I believe it‚Äôs Vu.
  - 2024-12-11 | 7/17/24 was the last time we spoke then he reached out on 12/4
  - 2024-12-11 | Hi <@454372168852045844> , 
Khoa, username alycubo, joined the program in Sept 2023 shortly after I joined. He was a college student with a background in arbitrage.  


We were accountability partners up until we launched. But then he went quiet after getting suspended due to Inform ACT verification. His Amazon account is reactivated now though.

He initially reached out for tips on lowering ACOS and currently at 88%.
  - 2024-12-11 | Hi everyone, Khoa is asking how much premium membership for Shifu Discord is. I‚Äôm not sure how to answer that.
  - 2024-12-09 | Yeah that‚Äôs a very good idea. I‚Äôd hate to give them bad advice too. üò¨
  - 2024-12-09 | Yeah I was telling him to do the same. Glad I got that right üòÖ since I‚Äôm still learning PPC myself
  - 2024-12-09 | He asked to have a meeting and I gave him my availability for the weekend then he went silent üòë lol
Then this Saturday he asked for a meeting on the day of‚Ä¶ felt bad but I wasn‚Äôt able to make that work.
  - 2024-12-09 | This is a really tough situation.
  - 2024-12-09 | I believe you haha
  - 2024-12-09 | We only talked about PPC but seeing his listing now I realize he didn‚Äôt use the bundling strategy. So his offer is lacking against competitors. ü§î
  - 2024-12-09 | Ooh I see. When he first reached out to me a few weeks ago he stated he regretted joining the program. I told him he just needs to nurture his listing to increase his sales. He‚Äôs also comparing himself to others so I tried to explain that every product is different and has its seasons. I think he might need more mindset coaching and realistic expectations.
  - 2024-12-09 | Ah okay. Yeah he seemed pretty stressed. Sounds like you guys have a lot of info already then.
  - 2024-12-09 | Just an FYI, Tam reached out to me and I‚Äôm currently figuring out what his PPC strategy is since he‚Äôs been going negative. Once I get all the info I‚Äôll share it here to see how maybe Han or Susan can help him out.
  - 2024-12-07 | Just signed it.
  - 2024-12-06 | I appreciate it, I got that call scheduled.
  - 2024-12-06 | Thank you Susan! I‚Äôm glad to be surrounded by you all that are at a higher level. Hoping I can scale up following along.
  - 2024-12-06 | Thank you Tom!

  - 2024-11-15 | SHelp. Someone bought from my FBM, just using it for my FBM reviews. I still have 2 returned stocks available in FBA. Is there a way to send my FBA stock using MCF to fulfil my FBM order? Or should I just contact the buyer and let them know that I am out of stock and cancel that order?
  - 2024-11-13 | All good. Will do that. Thanks Chloe.

  - 2024-04-25 | I already got my business name. Question: Do I place ***"Business name" Pty Ltd*** as my Amazon store or I can just use the business name without Pty Ltd?
  - 2024-12-09 | Congratulations!!! ‚≠ê
  - 2024-12-06 | Happy Birthday Susan!!! May your day be as awesome as you and hope you get spoiled rotten by you family. God bless you! <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-10-23 | Ok. Thanks Susan.
  - 2024-10-23 | Will it make a difference on relaunch if I slow down my sales? Lower my PPC bids? I will still be sold out before the 2nd batch arrives.
  - 2024-10-08 | Got it! Thanks for A++ advice. üòä
  - 2024-10-08 | I am running out of budget on 2 of my campaigns, I have increased it and still running out. Do u suggest increasing still? I have 14 sales since prime day started.
  - 2024-10-07 | Ok. Like right now, with the price I am selling. I have 30% profit margjn. If I give 20% off it would be around 20% profit margin. Do you recommend increasing the price a little bit so when you do a 20% discount, the profit margin would be around 25%?
  - 2024-10-06 | When doing prime sales, how much profit margin are you guys willing to go down to?
  - 2024-09-29 | the one that looks like this?
  - 2024-09-29 | ok. thanks Engel. Do you have a link to the PPC optimization sheet?
  - 2024-09-29 | +ppc optimization sheet. Or is there a place where it is stored and we can just download it?
  - 2024-09-29 | Can I have the link to the ppc tracking sheet pls

  - 2024-11-30 | So I saved $820 by choosing the  5 option.
  - 2024-11-30 | I asked Macy's shipping contact to give me a computatio  for the 2 and 5 warehouses. 5 warehouses was almost $500 cheaper. you don't have to pay $320 to amazon if u do 2 warehouses.
  - 2024-11-30 | Hi Hannah. Are your products ready to ship? Or you just want to get an estimate? If just an estimate, you can send any amazon warehouse address near you. If your products are ready to ship, you create shipping label via seller central. There is a video in the vault on how to create labels. When you choose 1,2,5 warehouses Amazon will send you the addresses. You don't get to choose which warehouses.
  - 2024-11-29 | When I engage with them, I always ask if we can use their vids in other platform. Some are ok, some want you to add more $$.
  - 2024-11-29 | If they give you permission, then yes you can post in other platforms. Just make sure you keep the email trail as evidence if you have not made a contract with them.
  - 2024-11-27 | Amazon has changed shipping to 1,2,5 destinations, not sure when that changed. I am just trying to figure out which option offers the best value in terms of cost  and shipping time. Thank you for your insights guys. <@536075832658231299> <@297667891992723457>
  - 2024-11-27 | ok. thank Chloe.
  - 2024-11-26 | there was a discussion in Susan's class about shipping to East coast or West coast.  What was the recommendation again? Was that you <@1168356026471436323> who said something about it? Which is cheaper? Which is much faster?
  - 2024-11-19 | Are there new shipping agents?
  - 2024-11-12 | I am in this stage now. I changed my add-ons to a totally different ones so part my unboxing videos will be edited out. If you have to choose one, do the product feature instead of unboxing. And add an unboxing video when you have your new design. Hope that helps.

  - 2024-12-09 | Okay, thanks
  - 2024-12-09 | It is still not showing the variation on the listing but the reviews are showing up on the brown now.
  - 2024-12-07 | And this is the one we just made?
  - 2024-12-07 | This is the one I need to delete, right? this is the one one as it is still FBA.
  - 2024-12-07 | 
  - 2024-12-07 | it still does not show the variation on the listing
  - 2024-12-07 | is this correct now? do I need to change it to FBA?

  - 2024-11-28 | that is how the listing looks like when I do "edit listing"
  - 2024-11-28 | I just wanted to see how the SKU parent/child relationship. This looks ok right? I don't need to do anything else?
  - 2024-11-28 | I have not changed anything from when I first made it. Do I need to make any changes?

  - 2024-11-27 | does this mean it has been resolved?
  - 2024-11-27 | 
  - 2024-11-27 | I just acknowledged the violation then they sent me the email below
  - 2024-11-27 | that is what comes out when I click the variation
  - 2024-11-26 | this is how my listing looks like. same as yesterday. I don't know what listing they deleted as it still looks the same.
  - 2024-11-26 | and acknowledged the violation. Is there anything else I need to do?
  - 2024-11-26 | 
  - 2024-11-26 | I went to "account health"
  - 2024-11-26 | Just received this email. It says there's a duplication of the listing( Parent/Child). It also says the listing has been removed. When I check my listing, the parent/child are still there. I am not sure what to do about this.
  - 2024-11-24 | thank you so much <@536075832658231299> for your help. ‚òùÔ∏è
  - 2024-11-24 | i just had a read online. there needs to be available inventory for the variations to show on your listing. all good then.
  - 2024-11-24 | How do I make my lsiting look like this?? where it shows a ll the shoppable colors in the ad.
  - 2024-11-24 | nevermind. all good. both listings came out after a few minutes.
  - 2024-11-24 | But it show as 2 variations
  - 2024-11-24 | I submitted but only one child(brown) is under the parent
  - 2024-11-23 | I have just saved it into drafts for now
  - 2024-11-23 | I tried submitting but there was an error. What should I place on the SKU?
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-22 | I have made a new listing and sent the new FNSKU for brown variation to the supplier
  - 2024-11-22 | Will it make a new asin and not connect to the old reviews? Or it connects once parent listing is made and placed together?
  - 2024-11-22 | Ok. Will do step 1.
  - 2024-11-22 | .
  - 2024-11-22 | So this is my new add-ons for the beige and the brown color.
  - 2024-11-22 | My listing has the beige color. I want to add a brown color variation
  - 2024-11-22 | 
  - 2024-11-22 | 
  - 2024-11-21 | Can you please send me a detailed instruction or a video perhaps on how to do it? Thank u
  - 2024-11-21 | Just checked your availability. Earliest is the 26th Nov. I need to do it soon as supplier needs to place new FNSKU on the box.
  - 2024-11-21 | I could use my 1:1 call to help me go through it.
  - 2024-11-21 | Is it easy to do?
  - 2024-11-21 | Yes please. I placed a message on the active support chat as well. Not sure how it got deleted.  I have been warching youtube videos but it is so confusing and I don't want to mess it up.

  - 2024-12-11 | Congratulations!
  - 2023-12-28 | I won‚Äôt be able to make it this Sunday because I have work.
  - 2024-12-06 | Happy birthday <@1066465177140215928> !
  - 2024-10-21 | okay, thank you!
  - 2024-10-21 | Hey <@536075832658231299>, the PPC is the PPC assistant form right?
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, thank you for yalls help! Gotta head back to work
  - 2024-10-11 | I just sent a polite email stating feedback edits because he said what edits do I want from this morning. He said "people get the jest of the product from what I showed, and if i add anymore stuff it'll drop my audiences retention and views.
  - 2024-10-11 | I mean he had a list of things to highlight, because this is a paid one. He highlighted nothing and mentioned incorrect information on the video! He didn't mention one thing and says on the video "I'm not going to connect that right now because I don't have time"
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | he doesnt even have the correct stuff while talking about it
  - 2024-10-11 | yea the post is so crappy haha, we had told him what to feature and he did none put just pretty much plugged it in and turned it on. Then showed my bundles
  - 2024-10-11 | haha yeah
  - 2024-10-11 | im just so annoyed of him
  - 2024-10-11 | We also gave him the option to opt out when we had to update the software, he said he will wait.
  - 2024-10-11 | I'm going to send this to him because he's being childish and had several emails today stating how hard he has worked. And he said its been sitting in his draft box since Tuesday and just forgot to send till this morning. Lies. 

We apologize for the initial pause in production due to the software update, and we appreciate your patience in waiting for the new version to arrive. However, despite the agreed-upon deliverable dates, there have been ongoing delays. We understand that you sent the video this morning after we had already communicated our decision to part ways and requested a refund. Although you mentioned the video was recorded earlier in September, the timestamp on our product, which displays real-time, shows today's date, 10/11/24. We will accept this video and conclude our sponsorship following its submission. Thank you for your time, and we wish you the best in your future endeavors.
  - 2024-10-11 | thank you both for your inputs, ppl are shitty haha
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, yeah makes sense
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah, that's what im afraid of
  - 2024-10-11 | or have people buy and post lots of 1 review
  - 2024-10-11 | hahah
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont like him either haha, that's why i wanted to dispute but he seems childish and I dont want backlash
  - 2024-10-11 | Just wanted to see if you advice disputing or taking a loss to prevent backlash? Has this happened to you before?
  - 2024-10-11 | and he keeps emailing saying he wont refund becuase he put so much work into this
  - 2024-10-11 | I sent the request for refund to keep it cordial and he sent a crappy video this morning. He said we wont refund because he has spent hours and hours working on this. My device on the video shows a time stamped he recorded it this morning
  - 2024-10-11 | service
  - 2024-10-11 | Help! Wanted to ask for any advice on this situation Im currently experiencing. I have an influencer I'm working with, paid a deposit already. He was suppose to post a video in august and he kept delaying and not responding. He finally responded in sept when we asked to part ways and get a refund. He said his technician has been on vacation and he couldn't get the recordings done and will be able to have it done be 9/20. 9/21 came and he delayed it again. Multiple follow ups every other day and no response. Yesterday we sent another letter to part ways due to it past deadline again and he said he will send it today at noon. I still wanted to part ways bc its past my prime day and wanted it before then. He got upset and said he is not refunding something hes spent hours and hours on. He sent a video this morning and the time stamp shows he recorded it this morning and sent it to me 30 mins after he finished recording. I sent a refund request and he denied it even though the video is terrible. Would you still file a dispute on paypal or take a loss?

  - 2024-12-11 | Working on my reviews through vine and other platforms. I also filled out my PPC assistant document so I am excited to optimize my PPC within the next week.
  - 2024-12-11 | This is so awesome!
  - 2024-12-10 | finally got my video back from the fivver contact I found. It looks really good. However, I should have checked where he was based because I had to ship my product internationally to him and between the shipping fee and import fee I over doubled my cost. Rookie mistake but I still got a solid video out off the deal so it could be worse. I am now working on updating my PPC and obtaining more reviews.
  - 2024-12-04 | checking PPC and Reviews today. I also am going to work on optimizing my campaign today. My product video should be done soon so I am looking forward to adding that to my listing.
  - 2024-12-03 | I just launched a couple weeks ago and am monitoring my PPC, as well as working on FBM orders and my videographer who is completing a video for my product. Been a little disappointed with the orders I have been getting vs the PPC cost but I am trying to stay patient. Making sure my priorities are set every day before I start working.

  - 2024-12-12 | Yes. This is the first listing I created under that ASIN. How do I turn off A/B test?
  - 2024-12-10 | That shouldn't be the problem. I have been trying to get it changed for weeks and for some reason it won't update. Thanks for the suggestion though.
  - 2024-12-10 | I updated my product listing title and in amazon seller central under "manage inventory" the title is showing updated. However, when I open it up under a buyer profile it is still showing the old listing title. I tried resubmitting it a few times and no change. Has this happened to anyone else?
  - 2024-11-12 | I am trying to figure out what videos I want on my listing and am stuck between getting someone to do an unboxing or hiring someone to do an actual product video with voiceover and music. Has anyone had better success with one or the other? I am a little skeptical to spend too much because there are some changes I want to make in my next shipment including the design of the box so I will probably end up having to redue some of the listing videos. I am leaning towards doing a product review without the box in it because then I can use the video even after I update the packaging.

  - 2024-12-13 | would it work to submit a screenshot or do I need to keep it in the .csv file? Not sure why the above error is happening. Have you had this happen with anyone else before? Thanks.
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | when I save it it says .csv but and it shows the following table (first pic) but when I upload it to ppc assistant form and open it, it displays as the 2nd pic. Is this what you are seeing on your end? Not sure where the error is happening. I am downloading from amazon and uploading to the ppc assistant form without changing anything.
  - 2024-12-11 | Thanks Susan, I just submitted my documents for PPC assistant. I am really doing bad on ACOS on the ASIN campaign. I am not sure exactly what is causing it to do so poorly. Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi Han,
My targeting tab on amazon ads is still showing the "temporarily removed sponsored display data from this page" message. I would like to use PPC assistant but cant download any files. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can bypass this? Do you think if I call the amazon team they can help with this?  Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-12-06 | sounds good. I will wait for that to be fixed then submit my PPC Assistant. Thanks.
  - 2024-12-04 | 
  - 2024-12-04 | hi Han,
when I went to the targeting tab I got the following error message and when I exported my data from the last 2 weeks I got this document with no impressions. Have you ever seen this "removed sponser display data" note before? Do I just have to wait until amazon fixes it to export a document with real data? Thanks!
  - 2024-11-13 | nevermind, susan let me know she was the one who looked at my keyword research. Thought that was you Han. Sorry about that. Ill see you on Friday for our 1 on 1 meeting. Thanks.
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Han, I submitted my PPC keyword analysis and got the attached email back with no coaching comments. Did you or someone else get a chance to look at this? I am going to schedule a 1 on 1 meeting in your calendar. I have my 5 reviews made just waiting for them to load onto my account so I believe my listing is ready for launch besides the video I still need. Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-11-11 | I apologize. I was out of town in North Carolina for work the last 6 days and didn't have much access to discord or work on my product at all. I just sent Han my PPC Keyword research and am going to schedule a call once I get my 5 FBM review loaded onto my listing. I will try to keep up on the homework this week.

  - 2024-02-04 | I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who donated to our tutoring hall. Things have been really busy with us preparing for our classes starting in a couple of weeks.

  - 2024-02-02 | Thank you brother. They are a big part of my "why"
  - 2024-02-02 | Hi Edward. I don't live in Philippines but the charity work I do is out there.
  - 2024-01-31 | 
  - 2024-01-31 | Hi All! Today is the last day of our official fundraiser. We didn't hit our goal, but we made some good progress. And I am super appreciative of the Shifu Family. Y'all donated half of what was raised, so super thank you to you all! And thank you to the Shifu's for allowing me this platform to share. Also,  I wanted to share the winners of a drawing contest I held for January. The kids' age ranged from 6-20 that participated. Here are the 1st and 2nd place winners in each age group. 1st place won 1000pesos = $18 and 2nd place won 300pesos= $5.50. Not huge prizes in regards to U.S. dollars, but in pesos, that's significant. These prizes were personally funded by me and doesn't come out of the donated funds from the GoFundMe fundraiser. I will continue to keep the fundraiser active should anyone else like to donate in the future, but I won't be soliciting on here anymore out of respect of other charity initiatives.  https://gofund.me/bca9ef76 . Thank you all!
  - 2024-01-27 | Here's a quick update on our tutoring hall. We are installing our railing leading to the tutoring hall today. It's the last piece of the facility to be installed. Thank you to those who donated. We still are hoping to hit our $5k by next month, but if not, we will still make things happen. The kids are worth it. Thank you for letting me share.
  - 2024-01-24 | Some of the kids that will be attending our tutoring hall wanted to say Thank You to our donors and future donors. You're making a huge difference.
  - 2024-01-22 | Here's a short video of our kids starting to use the hall for a drawing contest I've created for them. They are so excited to use the room and the supplies we have. Most of their classrooms are packed with 50+ kids in a room with no Air Conditioning. Right now we can only afford fans but that's fine for now. It will get warmer during the summer. We focus primarily on kids that can't afford to go to school or struggle to keep up with their lessons. The education system there tends to push kids into the next grade even if they aren't understanding well. This is why we have 7th graders here that still struggle to read or write. And parents are encouraged to teach their kids what their teachers don't, however, they don't know how to read or write themselves. So we hope this will be a beacon of hope for the kids in our village to have a proper education so they can have a chance to prosper.
  - 2024-01-22 | Quick update. Thanks everyone who has donated so far. We raised enough funds for a printer and paper! Here's my mom with our new printer. I'm very grateful to have her help since I run all purchases through her since she's there. We will now be able to print out handouts, enrollment forms, and other learning material for the kids. Thank you!
  - 2024-01-22 | 
  - 2024-01-22 | Thank you Shifu Family for donating to the charity work we are doing in the Philippines. Thank you to Susan Hang, Linh Doan, Joan Lovelle Alfeche, Davis Truong, Michael Lee and Phuong Nguyen for donating so far! You've gotten us even closer to our goal. Our fundraiser is still going until February, so if you'd still like to contribute, please visit our GoFundMe link. We now have enough funds to buy a printer and some school supplies, so your money is already being put to great use. üôÇ . https://gofund.me/bca9ef76

  - 2024-12-11 | 1. Never doubt yourself. You are more capable than you think.

2. Spend time building meaningful relationships and learn as much as you can (Although I believe you should never stop learning)

3. Invest in yourself, your mental, and take care of yourself well. Only you can love yourself the most. ‚ô•Ô∏è

  - 2024-12-09 | Today‚Äôs ‚ÄúMindset Monday‚Äù was enjoyable and insightful. Shift Charlie talked about how important it is to make time and reflect on our progress and goals.  

Understand who we are and who we want to be is a good start and using that to leverage our next steps. Our next steps being small and overtime it will help us accomplish what we desired. Sometimes when you get too excited for something and go in strong might not always be the best outcome. 

Thank you for the session today! Time to reflect üôÇ

  - 2024-11-05 | Hi <@536075832658231299> where can I see my homework results?
  - 2024-12-10 | Good morning <@536075832658231299> , After looking for products with prices that stand out from the others, I got the sample, but the sample is not good enough to compare with a competitor. It is similar to the big brand names on the market. They have a good outfit, and the design package is so professional. So now I am looking for another one that has a design that is not on the market now, and they have new technology that uses solar instead of batteries. Today, I will order the sample.
  - 2024-12-05 | The others sample, 1 have design never has in this market, and one have the newest feature like solar instead battery.
  - 2024-12-05 | Of course,  the first sample, I just focused on the price and smart features. Actually, it is an one still good on market now but I dont like the design and colors it is not professional.
  - 2024-12-05 | Alright. Thanks Han.

  - 2024-12-12 | Hi everyone, I‚Äôm trying to post a dummy listing and I clicked on the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a product ID‚Äù but it is now requesting an GTIN exemption application, has this happened to anyone ? Do I have to buy a UPC code ? Or is there another way that I may not be aware of ?

  - 2024-12-03 | Hi everyone, this may be a stupid question cause I‚Äôm assuming it works the same for all platforms but if I cancel manychat and I reactivate after a couple months will the things I have done be saved? The connection with fb for example

  - 2024-12-11 | I will give it another try and we see how it goes!
  - 2024-12-11 | Yes and it makes it more difficult I get it, it‚Äôs just how are other sellers selling that‚Äôs why I want to try
  - 2024-12-11 | Yes definitely I will take a look at competitors also!!
  - 2024-12-11 | Yes makes sense, I wasn‚Äôt clear enough!
  - 2024-12-11 | Okay I will do under my brand, thank you so so much! I really appreciate the help because it‚Äôs very much needed!!
  - 2024-12-11 | Sorry to keep texting for small questions that I could have solved myself, it‚Äôs just because of everything going not so well I panic with every little thing!
  - 2024-12-11 | The inactive listing is still under the brand name omg I just realized I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm so stupid I had created another listing of another product  under the brand name and it was fine on seller central I just got scared!
  - 2024-12-11 | No I received an email that said the trademark is suspended but seller central hasn‚Äôt removed it
  - 2024-12-11 | So I discussed with Justin and there were a few ideas. 
1. I am in search for a facility to store my 600units so it‚Äôs cheaper than AMZ storage
2. I contacted a few people of fiver if they can help with reactivation of current listing, in the meantime I want to post a new listing to see if the issue is still there since I haven‚Äôt tried reactivation in a while. 
3. If reactivation does not work we will try to sell the products locally but will not bring back to Canada too much money. 
4. worst case scenario if nothing works we will dump the units and move on. 
5. We also contacted our supplier to see if they‚Äôd want them back no response yet!
6. My question is since my trademark was suspended (because very similar to another) I am unsure if I should post the new listing under the brand name we have or generic!
  - 2024-12-11 | Ok I will explain sorry if I was confusing
  - 2024-12-11 | I apologize for not replying earlier, so many things are going on at the moment!
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi there, thank you for reaching out! I had an issue with a product I had sent to amz warehouse but unfortunately my listing got rejected even though other sellers are still selling! I spoke with shifu Justin and he suggested to recreate a listing, at the moment my trademark is suspended. Should I create a new listing under generic or under my brand is fine also? Thank you so much!!

To further ensure compliance with Amazon‚Äôs policies:

3. Regular Training: Our team will undergo detailed training on Amazon‚Äôs policies to avoid future violations.

4. Quarterly Audits: We will conduct quarterly audits of all marketing and customer communication materials to ensure continued compliance.

5. Restricted Communications: All customer communication will occur only through Amazon‚Äôs messaging tools.

I am eager to resolve this matter promptly, continue adhering to Amazon‚Äôs policies, and I'm committed to maintaining a transparent and ensuring a compliant relationship with Amazon and its customers.

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,
Li
  - 2024-12-12 | Hi Amazon Team, 

It was really nice speaking with you on the phone. Thank you so much for clarifying my queries before I send out another appeal. As requested and understood, here are the responses to your questions:
    
1. Methods Used to Obtain Customer Information:
We did not use any methods to collect customers‚Äô personal information for incentivizing or manipulating reviews. The QR code on our product insert is solely for directing customers to register for a lifetime warranty. It does not collect information for review purposes.
    
2. Start Date for Product Review Abuse:
There has been no product review abuse from our side. We have never incentivized or asked customers for reviews.
    
3. Third-Party Contact Information:
No third-party services, companies, or external groups were used to obtain customer personal information or solicit reviews.
    
4. Documentation from Third Parties:
Since no third parties were involved, there are no documents, emails, or receipts related to such services.
    
5. Documents, QR Code End-to-End Experience:
I have attached  screenshots in my previous appeal showing the full experience of the QR code flow. It directs customers to register for their lifetime warranty, without mentioning reviews or asking for them. We also never obtained any personal information from customers, other than their Order ID, just so we can take note of customers' future warranty claims.
  - 2024-12-12 | this was my previous insert card design. do you think i can send them this as also? but it has my website underneath.
  - 2024-12-12 | hi shifu han, just spoke with account health. they said basically i need to answer to their questions. and also give a more detailed plan that explains how i will prevent customer reviews manipulation in the future. just wondering if by any chance you have a Steps of Prevention letter that you submitted previously? perhaps I could use it and reword it. seems like the one I sent earlier on is not detailed enough. thanks in advance!!
  - 2024-12-12 | Thanks shifu Han!

  - 2024-12-12 | Dear Amazon Team,

I hope this message finds you well. Below is a detailed summary of my situation, answers to the questions provided, and the corrective actions I have taken to ensure compliance with Amazon‚Äôs policies.

Detailed Summary

I recently received a warning regarding a violation of Amazon‚Äôs Customer Product Reviews Policies. I submitted an explanation clarifying that the QR code included with my product is solely for warranty registration and not intended to incentivize or manipulate customer reviews. Additionally, I outlined the steps I have taken to address the matter, including removing units for inspection, redesigning the product insert, and implementing stricter compliance measures.

Despite this, I received the same response from Amazon, and I wish to clarify the situation further through our scheduled call.
  - 2024-12-12 | hi shifu han good morning, ok noted on the above. i tried calling them but the account health call center is closed. I'm scheduling a call with them first thing tonight. if they still require me to answer those questions, do you think I can write this as my appeal? Since these were the questions they posted to me again, i answered them all but basically denied everything:
  - 2024-12-11 | Did they respond like this too with your case last time?
  - 2024-12-11 | Should I resubmit the same appeal?
  - 2024-12-11 | I received this reply. Could you please guide me further on this <@536075832658231299> ? Thanks so much again üôè

  - 2024-12-11 | Pray that it‚Äôll be all ok ü•πüôè
  - 2024-12-11 | So I‚Äôll proceed to appeal now.
  - 2024-12-11 | Thanks shifu üôåüèº
  - 2024-12-11 | here right?
  - 2024-12-11 | also for removing the units, do i create an MCF order? i tried going to Create Removal order but there's no option to remove any fulfillable units.
  - 2024-12-11 | can you just double check the appeal and letter again before i send them out to amazon please. thank you so much han i appreciate you üôå
  - 2024-12-11 | okay. so i don't include the QR code that was on the insert card too for the appeal? just send them the screenshots of the customer pov manychat?
  - 2024-12-11 | so i shouldn't send them the review and reply unless they ask.. right?
  - 2024-12-11 | 
  - 2024-12-11 | but it was sent via manychat. is that ok? in the policies they restrict us from directly communicating with customers via other channels
  - 2024-12-11 | they might ask for my insert card picture. the gift activation part might be labelled as misleading though.
  - 2024-12-11 | should i include the QR code that is on the insert card then in the first appeal compliance letter?
  - 2024-12-11 | Another possible reason why my listing was flagged is because a customer mentioned that in his review‚Ä¶ I tried to message him directly to let him know that a review wasn‚Äôt required for the warranty but he still didn‚Äôt take it down.
  - 2024-12-11 | I don‚Äôt have a copy of my insert card but this was sent to me by my supplier before. Is this sufficient if just front page since it‚Äôs empty behind?
Otherwise I‚Äôll go print it out at a shop later but I have no product to show.
  - 2024-12-11 | OK will remove 50 units and just say I've withdrawn inventory with the order ID. so along with these 2 letters i'll attach my:
1. screenshots of the new flow
2. screenshot of inventory removal
3. QR code
  - 2024-12-11 | Letter 2 (Steps of Prevention):

Steps of Prevention

Moving forward, we will:

1. Review All Marketing Materials: Conduct quarterly audits to ensure that all product inserts and communications align with Amazon‚Äôs policies.
2. Limit Insert Content: Include only essential information, such as warranty registration or product support, avoiding any language that could be interpreted as influencing reviews.
3. Direct Communication through Amazon Tools: Use Amazon‚Äôs messaging system exclusively for necessary customer communications to avoid any ambiguity.
4. Consult Policy Experts: Regularly consult with professionals to keep up-to-date with Amazon‚Äôs guidelines.

We are committed to maintaining a transparent and compliant relationship with Amazon and its customers.

Thank you for considering this appeal. We are eager to continue providing excellent service and products while adhering to Amazon‚Äôs policies. Please feel free to reach out if further information or clarification is required.

Sincerely,
Li Tan

Subject: Appeal for Review Manipulation Warning and Plan for Compliance

Dear Amazon Team,

I am writing to address the recent notification regarding a violation of Amazon‚Äôs Customer Product Reviews Policies. I take these policies very seriously and appreciate the opportunity to clarify the situation, share our corrective actions, and outline the steps we will take to ensure full compliance moving forward.

Explanation of the Situation
Our product packaging includes a QR code that redirects customers to register for a lifetime warranty. This initiative is purely a marketing strategy aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction and encouraging word-of-mouth promotion. It has never been our intention to influence customer reviews or offer incentives for reviews.

To demonstrate our good faith, I have included:

1. Screenshots from a customer‚Äôs perspective showing the exact flow upon scanning the QR code, which leads directly to the warranty registration page.
2. The QR code that was on the insert card.

Corrective Actions
To address this issue, we will implement the following measures immediately:

1. Inspection of Inventory: We will initiate a removal from Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment centers to inspect and ensure that the product insert complies fully with Amazon‚Äôs policies. (Removal order ID: xxxx)
2. Redesign of Insert Card: If there are any references or content that could be misconstrued as incentivizing reviews will be completely removed.
3. Staff Training: Our team will undergo additional training on Amazon‚Äôs policies to prevent any future unintentional violations.
4. Process Audit: We will conduct regular reviews of all customer communication materials to ensure compliance with Amazon‚Äôs guidelines.

  - 2024-12-11 | Ok. let me work on this step by step according to your guidance and come back here once I've done it. Thanks so much again shifu han üôè
  - 2024-12-11 | this is my actual flow. the messages i sent previously was sent manually by me because manychat didn't automate... can i edit the flow?
  - 2024-12-11 | do i just turn it off by swiping the toggle button? is this switched off
  - 2024-12-11 | i have a feeling that amazon sent detectives to test on my chat flow. if this Veronica is that person and Amazon finds out that I actually did offer a gift reward, will lying get me into trouble though?

  - 2024-12-11 | 1. My top 3 goals for this week are to sell out of stock, work on getting organic reviews, and place my next bulk order!
2. I only have 3 left in stock so sell out by tomorrow and I have already placed my bulk order which will be done by 2 months.
3. Due date: 2 months
4. Support I would need is to get more FBM reviews as well as more organic reviews.
  - 2024-11-29 | Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Grateful for everything I've achieved this year as well as my loved ones! Also very grateful for you guys and this awesome community!
  - 2024-11-25 | I just finished my call with Justin. I want to share some tips for you guys to improve! So make sure you set up your Sellerboard if you just launched, as well as your Manychat to rack up reviews/potential reviewers! It's best to find ways to get reviews before you hit that negative review. Also try to reach your goal and exceed your own expectations as well as your customer's!
  - 2024-11-29 | Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Grateful for everything I've achieved this year as well as my loved ones! Also very grateful for you guys and this awesome community!

  - 2024-12-02 | oh ok so on hand is available + FC transfer
  - 2024-12-02 | ?
  - 2024-12-02 | does that mean I actually have 62 units still available
  - 2024-12-02 | which i am a bit confused about
  - 2024-12-02 | 
  - 2024-12-02 | hi guys, so i sold out for black friday. I am in the process of ordering my next batch. what is the difference between on hand and available? On hand it says I have 62 units left, but available is 0. Though Amazon has not marked it as out of stock.
  - 2024-11-26 | thanks Han
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi guys! So I have a quick question. I have my funds from my sales but I have a negative balance. It‚Äôs from charges from my ads, should I turn off my ads for now and turn it on when my funds load?

  - 2024-11-12 | I have no clue why it was removed ü•≤
  - 2024-11-12 | It was Louis and Khoa
  - 2024-11-09 | was there any violations in these reviews?
  - 2024-11-09 | with videos
  - 2024-11-09 | 2. Tagline: Great product great price. = I went camping with one of my friends and they had one similar to this one. After receiving this product, I can tell that it is much higher quality and I love it so much already. I tried all the features and function and it was great. Definitely 10/10!!!
  - 2024-11-09 | 1. Tagline: Perfect for Security and Peace of Mind = Working the graveyard shift as a security guard, I bought these to use at night. I've tried other brands, but Virtual Haven's goggles are by far the best. The images are sharp, and the IR illuminator works flawlessly even in complete darkness. These goggles are well-built and rugged, which is a huge plus since I often work in harsh weather conditions. The battery life is excellent, lasting through my entire shift.

  - 2024-10-25 | all good thank u
  - 2024-10-25 | i tried just the 725-210-7249 but it wont let me either
  - 2024-10-25 | Hi <@536075832658231299> it wont let me schedule a meeting wd u. the phone number Im trying to key in says invalid but this is the number Im using. 

Phone no: 725-210-7249.
  - 2024-10-16 | I'm just really afraid that if we change anything in the listing may mess up what we currently have and will have to go through the review process again... but pls let me know if u think otherwise. thank u
  - 2024-10-16 | Is the deep link mandatory? since we're not hiring freelancers to do the reviews. But instead, we'll have maybe 2 or 3 of our staff make the purchase and then reimbursed and will do the reviews
  - 2024-10-16 | 
  - 2024-10-16 | my concern is that if I do that, I'm afraid it'll mess up the previous data we have for the listing and may lead to another listing review.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hello <@1066465177140215928> I tried changing the product title but it won't give me the option to just change the title b/c it prompts us to update the whole listing.
  - 2024-10-16 | Thanks Han. I was trying to create a deeplink using this link which incl our ASIN but not getting any results  -- https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thermal+label+printer&hidden-keywords=[B0D937HW3R]&ref=nb_sb_noss_1
  - 2024-10-15 | Good morning @everyonecould I get your thoughts on the above please? Thank u
  - 2024-10-14 | My IP address is already registered with our Seller Central account. Im just afraid that it will create an issue or red flag if I create a deeplink using the same device, considering that I am located in the Philippines and not in the US?
  - 2024-10-14 | Q2: re: the creation of deeplink. 

the instructions said that it was meant for a freelancer through Upwork... Is it okay to create deeplink acct using the same device, IP address and email we use for our Seller acct,
  - 2024-10-14 | and so I was wondering if its possible or better if I just copy the listing and then add another condition then set up fbm
  - 2024-10-14 | Hello @everyone, could I pls get ur thoughts on this-- I notice that whenever we click on add another condition and set up an fbm... the listing changes from fba to fbm

  - 2024-12-10 | You can just create a listing yourself. They are essentially the middleman looking to make some profit.  It's not a big deal as it's driving sales for you. Only concern is the lack of control with regards to customer service/support.
  - 2024-12-10 | You can actually report them if you want. End of the day, they are making profit from the difference. When you run sales, they might purchase it to sell as a profit on eBay.
  - 2024-12-09 | Hi Tim. Did you see any returns from them? They could be drop shipping your product.
  - 2024-12-04 | Hi Sovatha, 1 UPC for each Variation (SKU)
  - 2024-11-22 | You will. There will be a parent listing and your variations will be the child
  - 2024-11-22 | There are some requirements in terms of what is needed to be filled out based on the product category that you're in.
  - 2024-11-22 | <@1167106129415909496> - Hi Trish. It's been awhile since I created variations, but you can start by going to your "Inventory > Manage All Inventory" in Seller Central.  

From there, click on "Add a Variation" located at the top right.  Follow the instructions in the Variation Wizard.
  - 2024-11-22 | You will. There will be a parent listing and your variations will be the child

  - 2024-11-22 | There are some requirements in terms of what is needed to be filled out based on the product category that you're in.
  - 2024-11-22 | <@1167106129415909496> - Hi Trish. It's been awhile since I created variations, but you can start by going to your "Inventory > Manage All Inventory" in Seller Central.  

From there, click on "Add a Variation" located at the top right.  Follow the instructions in the Variation Wizard.

  - 2024-12-10 | Awesome job!
  - 2024-03-05 | Hi everyone. When filing for a trademark, would you suggest paying for their service to search USPTO records? I did a high level search and it looks like there are no conflicts. However, just wanted to ensure it doesn't get denied and cause further delay.
  - 2024-12-09 | Congrats Bro!
  - 2024-12-06 | My kids did all the üéÑdecorations!
  - 2024-11-29 | Hi Hannah. The address and options to ship to will be provided to you once you start your shipping plan. You can get that started now and coordinate with your supplier if you're ready.
  - 2024-11-12 | That's correct. When you're planning your shipment, you would coordinate the locations with your freight forwarder. They'll let you know the price for the locations you selected. Once you both agree to the locations to be shipped to, you can finalize the shipment plan on Amazon.
  - 2024-11-12 | Hi Sovatha. That's correct. The maximum weight for an Amazon FBA box is 50 lbs, unless the box contains a single oversized item that weighs more than 50 lbs,which I don't think applies to most of us here.  

You can ship to 1, 3, or 5 locations. The assumption is that if you ship to multiple Amazon warehouses, the quicker your inventory will be available. However, I would check the amazon location with your freight forwarder to see which option is the most cost effective and makes the most sense for you. Most students here ship to 3 or 1 location.

  - 2024-12-11 | Hi. I would close the FBM unless you have inventory at home you're looking to sell.
  - 2024-11-22 | that should be fine, i usually set it a dollar or so lower to avoid it from getting supressed.. once schedule.. you'll see the Discounted Prime Price
  - 2024-11-12 | Jennifer,that's odd. I checked my other reviews and it's up. I can try to submit again.
  - 2024-12-09 | Hi Trish, it might not be showing up because you are out of stock. Quick way to verify is to add inventory in your FBM.
  - 2024-11-19 | The Delivery Window is based on it arriving to amazon warehouse..not the port.
  - 2024-11-19 | Hi <@1256245998255345695>. In your situation, it looks like 1 shipment might not arrive within the window you set for tomorrow. Worst case is they'll give you an alert/notification for you to acknowledge. Just be sure to monitor with your freight forwarder to prevent it from occurring too often.

You have the ability to always update your arrival window, ONLY if the date you set didn't pass. Therefore, since your freight forwarder didn't give you a tracking number, you should connect with them for updates to adjust your window accordingly.
  - 2024-11-14 | Yes. That's it
  - 2024-11-14 | You should see it there
  - 2024-11-14 | It's in your shipping queue
  - 2024-11-13 | then update your shipment window to ensure it arrives within that window
  - 2024-11-13 | ahh got it... you should be good. I would check with your freight forwarder once in a while to get an idea of where your inventory is at and when its scheduled to arrive at Port and ETA on when it will arrive to amazon warehouse...
  - 2024-11-13 | the shipment ID/reference ID is something they usually collect from us... did they notice your tracking number and just mentioned that it was wrong?
  - 2024-11-13 | as long as your inventory arrives within the window you set, you are totally fine
  - 2024-11-13 | however, in your case,  they didnt provide you one..so the method i provided you is the work around
  - 2024-11-13 | Amazon requires us to input a tracking number...
  - 2024-11-13 | If they are not providing you with a trackable Tracking number, it doesn't affect them at all
  - 2024-11-13 | the tracking number wasn't something they provided you correct?
  - 2024-11-13 | yea.. usually i supply the reference ID
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Kazoua! Your freight forwarder told you your shipping # is wrong?  Can you gather more info on what they are asking for? Could they possibly be asking for info from you (shipment id, reference id)?

If it's regarding Tracking #, you can always update that.
  - 2024-10-30 | however, if your freight forwarder doesn't have a valid tracking for you, please select "Others" ..amazon system will not check against anything..and your random character/numbers will be accepted
  - 2024-10-30 | If you selected a specific carrier, it will check against what you have selected..
  - 2024-10-30 | 
  - 2024-10-30 | Hi <@1256245998255345695> - Can you change your "Carrier" to "Others" and try again?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Hannah, during my sourcing phase, I had suppliers willing to do it without any cost as long as we handled the logistics and ship the add-on items to them. As Jamie mentioned, it'll depend on your negotiation and how accommodating your supplier is.
  - 2024-12-12 | Got it. I added the T&C over to my copy.
  - 2024-12-12 | <@454372168852045844> - Sure. I requested access to the doc below and will update my version.
  - 2024-12-09 | I agree. My suggestion to him was a result of me assuming he has some knowledge of PPC. Now looking back at it, he might be very limited. He probably isn't aware of your PPC Assistance.  During the meeting, you'll probably get a good sense of where he is at.
  - 2024-12-09 | yea i met with him super late at night one time ...i tried to accommodate
  - 2024-12-09 | He asked me if he should increase budget to get more sales.. i instructed him to optimize his PPC and cut out all the wasted ad spend..and naturally the spend will go into the kw that are working...
  - 2024-12-09 | He def is asking all the questions he should've asked prior to launching
  - 2024-12-09 | =X
  - 2024-12-09 | He is asking me to meet with me weekly.. i suggested he connect with you Susan/Han first... sorry
  - 2024-12-09 | https://a.co/d/8FBCO72
  - 2024-12-09 | haha but what do i know?
  - 2024-12-09 | I also notice he updated his listing main listing image as well..and it doesnt look eye catching tbh
  - 2024-12-09 | It's def going to be an uphill battle for him. His margin is razor thin at the price he is selling at.  His PPC, i dont think he optimized... so i told him, one way to lower ad spend is optimize and work on removing the bleeders....as susan mentioned, challenge is that he wants quick results and that isn't something that is reallistic
  - 2024-12-09 | I agree with you Tim. I had a meeting with him 2 weeks ago. I also know he didn't manage his PPC since he launched. I think he mentioned he didn't have much time and just recently started to focus on it
  - 2024-12-09 | He also said he let his PPC " go a little crazy to gain sales".....so looks like he went off the path to chase sales which is costing him.
  - 2024-12-09 | thats not counting PPC
  - 2024-12-09 | He is operating at a 7-8% margin
  - 2024-12-09 | Same. He just reached out to me as well.
  - 2024-12-09 | Morning All. Jenny Dean messaged me to ask about launching. She currently has 39 units available and 161 reserved, she was looking to launch.  I instructed her to connect with Susan/Han prior to launch to review her PPC. She thought she has to pay for the meeting/review.  I also instructed her to not launch until she has at least 100 units available.  

<@1066465177140215928> - I instructed her to connect with you first before a meeting with han.

I didn't see a private channel in discord, so just wanted to give everyone a heads up here.
  - 2024-12-09 | Hi Tom. 

Please see link below regarding the SOP for Ambassadors.  Please review and let me know if you need to add/remove/update anything.

Thanks
  - 2024-12-07 | Signed.
  - 2024-12-07 | Got it! She messaged me saying you both connected!
  - 2024-12-06 | <@297667891992723457> - Good to see you here!
  - 2024-12-06 | Hi all. Trish mentioned she has a  scheduled meeting with Han scheduled at 2pm PST. She's currently waiting and pinged me to see if I can connect with you <@536075832658231299> .
  - 2024-11-21 | No need to ask Kathy. It's been taking longer I noticed around this time. I have had units that got checked in about 3 weeks ago.. and im still waiting for it to become available.

  - 2024-11-18 | Hello everyone - when bulk order is ready for shipping, how many do you recommend shipping to your home for FBM?
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok! you should have it in your inbox in about 10 minutes
  - 2024-11-15 | Should I dM you this info or email?
  - 2024-11-15 | Yes I paid them. Everything is in motion with trademark. I applied for my brand regsitry and was declined. Do you think it was because one of my storefront was deactivated at that time? And I have to wait for brand approval before I create the listing and get the FNSKU for my product, is that correct?
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Minh. From what I understand the application takes up to 18 months for full approval. The Attorney didn't see any challenges with our trademark and have submitted the application for trademark. Attorney said to wait 10 days to apply for brand in which I did. I think at the time I applied for the brand, my canada store was deactivated due to no activity. Canada is now ative again and I submitted an appeal 2 days ago.
  - 2024-11-15 | Hello - Question about brand registry and when to create the listing to obtain the FNSKU. Are we supposed to wait for brand approval before creating the listing? I thought we were supposed to wait - but I went back to module 2 and in part 3 it said we need to take photos of our package with the FNSKU already on there and include it with the brand application. Please advise. Just started production and hopefully I can get this squared away soon.ü´§

  - 2024-12-05 | <@1059659092475531444> Can you please confirm if there's anything special I need to do to create the new listing under my brand? Or will it automatically go under the brand once the brand is approved and all I have to do is click on "Add product" at the top left corrner?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Jamie. Thanks for checking in. I'm doing well. Juggling work and new baby and fam. My brand was just approved and I'm working on creating listing for the FNSKU to send to suppllier. My product is ready to ship. Feeling a bit overwhelmed since I'm reaching unknown territory right now.
  - 2024-10-28 | Hello! To get the FNKSU barcode, should I create the code using the sample listing I created before? Or create a new listing of the actual product I am selling then create the FNSKU?
  - 2024-10-23 | Can you please remind me I have one free session with Justin to go over the product selected, is that correct? Should I scheudle the call with him now? We are about to design packaing for this product and place bulk order when completed.
  - 2024-10-23 | Sorry their description wasn't clear. They said we don;t need packaging details until 8-12 months after application has been submitted.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is this the order I should be taking? Or do I need to go ahead and place the bulk order now to get the photos?
  - 2024-10-16 | I was waiting for the trademark to get approved first before I design the packaging to be send to the supplier and then order the builk order.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hi! I;m a little confused and just about to start the tradmark process. One of the attorneys list of itmes needed is a photo of our logo on the package. I thought this wasn't needed until we start the brand registry.
  - 2024-12-13 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> - We got a new modem recently - does that erase the old IP address? No one we know has been to our home and signed in our inernet since we got the new one. Inquiring for the reviews. Thanks!

  - 2024-10-10 | Khanh Tran - jkookachu
  - 2024-12-10 | Great thank you for sharing! I will let you know if I have questions.
  - 2024-12-10 | Do I need to have brand registry done before the first bulk order? I plan to get a logo printed and custom packaging done so wasn‚Äôt sure if brand registry is done before or after placing first bulk order.
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi everyone! Thanks for checking in on me! I do have a question as I begin to choose my supplier and prepare for first bulk order.
  - 2024-10-20 | nvm I think it checked data on page 2 or something which is why it was low revenue?
  - 2024-10-20 | I just checked my product's market again today and total revenue went down to $50K. Is this something to be concerned if my product is not potential anymore?
  - 2024-10-17 | When ordering samples, it‚Äôs just to sample the product? No logo or custom box needed?
  - 2024-10-17 | I have one supplier that would only do custom box for 1000 MOQ. How important is it to have a custom box for launch?
  - 2024-10-16 | Okay thank you for your response <@1054411267340763216> and <@1066465177140215928>. I am able to negotiate down to 300 MOQ with black or gray color instead.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is it worth settling for a high MOQ of 1000 if I want to do a customized color for my product? Currently in the market, there are many black or gray colors. I noticed that the top selling competitor's product is a silver color.
  - 2024-10-14 | Did this happen because of the battery? Do I need to apply for that GTIN exemption?
  - 2024-10-14 | So should I already have found a supplier before making a dummy listing? Han said that the dummy listing doesn't need to be 100% correct so I haven't found a supplier yet.
  - 2024-10-14 | So my product has a battery, I'm not sure what type of battery and I tried to look at my competitor's listing to see if they list it but cannot find it. How should I fill out the battery questions?
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1054411267340763216> Just checking to see when you will share my product analysis for 15 and 16?
  - 2024-10-10 | ok thank you Han for answering!
  - 2024-10-10 | So I started Module 2 - Do I find a supplier first before creating a dummy listing? Minh said in the dummy listing video that I would need to get the product details like model number, etc. from the supplier.
  - 2024-10-10 | Hi <@536075832658231299>! I've completed intro module and module 1. Starting on Module 2 today.
  - 2024-11-01 | DONE <@1031622651468333076>
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi <@613172337470341150> fellow ENFP! Are you post-launch stage? Would love another accountability partner that is a stage ahead of me so that I can learn from your experience.
  - 2024-10-22 | <@1031622651468333076> Happy to be your accountability partner as your start your Amazon FBA journey!
  - 2024-10-22 | 
  - 2024-10-22 | My location is Washington, DC on the east coast. My strengths are research, mastery of online tools like Google apps & ChatGPT & project management tools like Trello. I am also an art director and graphic designer so I am opening to helping out with logo and packaging design!
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi! I'm in the product supplier sourcing stage so would love to find an AP similar to my stage! Happy to also mentor folks in product research stage.

Below is some important key points that will give you a higher chance to succeed in this journey.

1. Commiment: I know you guys have your life duties, but please commit to this journey and stay focus for the next 6 months.

2. Accountability: Keep yourself accountable, stay dedicated and put in the work required. Find an accountability partner will help as well. Remember, you're not in it alone, reach out for help when you face challenges.

3. Mindset: I wanna emphasize this is not an easy path. You willl for sure face a lot of challenges, roadblocks, and setbacks. But as long as you keep moving forward and don't quit, you'll find your way to success. Join Monday class with Shifu Charlie will help strengthening your mindset.

4. Stay Coachable: We can't teach people who don't have an open mind to learn new things. Once you get all the basic knowledge down, you can learn on your own all you want. But at first, listen to what we teach. My goal is to make you guys become more successful than me, so rest assure that I'll teach you everything I know as long as you listen.

---Thank you and let's get sh** done--
Han,
  - 2024-12-13 | what kind of black magic did you practice lol congrats
  - 2024-07-29 | Our friend finally reunited with her mother after 10 long years, but their time together was tragically cut short after only 9 months when her mom passed away unexpectedly last Thursday.
This sudden loss has left them unprepared both emotionally and financially as they were just newly college graduates and still have student loan debts.
Please join us in sending prayers and support to help her navigate this difficult time. Any prayer or contribution is genuinely appreciated.

  - 2024-12-12 | 30 max for every listing
  - 2024-12-12 | <=30
  - 2024-12-12 | that's exactly what I said during the class
  - 2024-12-11 | Second topic:
How to get more review with Vine
1. Create a entirely new listing exactly the same with your main listing
2. Send some inventory in <30
3. Sign up for Vine
4. After gettting the reviews, we can combine that new listing with the main listing under a same parent and reviews will be combine
```c
Implementation detail for step 4: Contact me when you're ready.
```
  - 2024-12-11 | 1.  Design your insert card so that it doesn't say anything related to "review, free gift". You only need 1 good reason for people to scan the qrcode. "Warranty" or "Free Ebook" is good enough. Don't include anything that could trigger their attention.
2. Inside Manychat flow, the first message is to give what you promise on the insert. You can ask for review later in the flow. We do this in case we got caught we can disconnect the later messages to prepare for an appeal.
3. Worst case if you get caught, do NOT admit anything, simply play dumb and try to appeal saying that the Insert card is a marketing strategy to give people more value in hope of referrals.
4. If they still deny, we can withdraw inventory and remove insert card then send it back, we can submit withdrawal IDs and submit prevention letter. The goal is to not lose the listing.
```cpp
Summary: Your insert card is the first gateway of them determine if you violate, so be cautious with what you put on there
```
  - 2024-12-11 | I just realized fathom wasn't working today
no recording smh
sorry guys.
If you miss today class, we discussed:
Manychat/Insert card design to stay safe
Addiional strategy on getting more than 30 reviews with vine.

Class today we will discuss PPC Practice 3.
Then we will talk about other ppc campaigns (overview)
  - 2024-12-04 | I'm ok guys just little headache let's hop on the call
  - 2024-12-04 | We can also discuss chinese new year time as well
  - 2024-12-04 | Hey guys, feel a bit under the weather today. I won't have a material to share but will be on call to answer questions and optimize your ppc or expose some of ppc-assistant logic if you care to know
  - 2024-11-07 | Check <#1199034625696219227>
  - 2024-11-08 | @everyone Quick announcement.
When you create your official listing (with brand name). Make sure you put in the correct title that you plan to use in the future, we have seen restriction with changing the title recently.
There are ways to update your title but it's a hassle and could waste your time so just be right at the beginning.
  - 2024-12-07 | why do you need to start a new one?
  - 2024-10-10 | yes every order goes through amazon so fbm should be on there
  - 2024-04-25 | Store name/brand name can be completely different than your business name
  - 2024-03-05 | Not really it's quite expensive. You can search on uspto website or pay a fiverr service for cheaper

  - 2024-01-30 | IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è : If you receive anything like the picture below in your mailbox after paying the TRADEMARK LAWYER online with IP ACCELERATOR. 
DO NOT PAY again, it's a SCAM!
  - 2024-01-30 | Dear Shifu family, @everyone 
It has been reported that some individuals are attempting to leverage the Amazon portal to solicit free products from sellers, in exchange for reviews. Please be aware that this practice is against Amazon's policy and could result in serious consequences for both parties involved, including account suspension.
‚ö†Ô∏è As a reminder, it's crucial that no mention of reviews, whether related to a request, an offer, or a negotiation, should be made through the Amazon portal. This includes all forms of communication - messages, customer support discussions, or any other interaction facilitated by Amazon.
  - 2024-01-30 | This is a new requirement under the transparency act. https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/boir/html .Who has a business entity needs to file this.
@everyone
  - 2024-12-09 | Be prepared ü´°
  - 2024-12-05 | 
  - 2024-12-04 | you can forward that to your ip lawyer
  - 2024-12-03 | let's aim to do this every month, you can input your last month data for now
  - 2024-12-02 | Hi @everyone launch members, please give me quick update on your store performance by filling this form here
https://airtable.com/appQIY56vYDVvdBkf/shraPE1hZTFeQ8gE3
  - 2024-11-22 | Isn't this the whole point of Data visibility?
  - 2024-10-21 | @everyone is ppc homework too difficult this week? Not many people submitted.
  - 2024-10-08 | We'll touch base on this
  - 2024-10-08 | I already monitor your launch bids they are good
  - 2024-10-07 | It's too late to increase price maybe next time, if you want to increase price do that 2 months before prime. 
But again, why do you have to do all that for just 2 days?
  - 2024-10-07 | The minimum discount for prime is 20% so depends on your margin you can decide to keep it 20% or give a but more
  - 2024-10-04 | just use your regular campaigns, don't need to change everything for just 2 days
  - 2024-10-04 | it does, you give amazon more money basically
  - 2024-09-29 | That's too high there must be something wrong
  - 2024-09-28 | I you do it, make sure you'll be profitable right at the beginning.
  - 2024-09-28 | But if I have to choose 1 to test it out, I'll go with page visits.
  - 2024-09-28 | well it entirely depends on your goal and your product performance.
And clearly it is not for new seller.
It's more for when you trying to grow your brand. As these campaigns won't give you product ranking
  - 2024-09-28 | these are Sponsored Brand campaigns
  - 2024-10-26 | @everyone please read this

  - 2024-10-28 | The tool gives you consistent logic while even for me, as a human, I can make bad decison on a bad day
  - 2024-10-28 | That's the purpose of ppc assistant. It'll give you what it thinks is good and you can decide.
If anything doesn't make sense then send it to me
  - 2024-10-24 | It's all relative, don't focus too much on the exact % but tryna pick up the pattern
  - 2024-10-24 | it wants to test more for that one since the spend is low

  - 2024-08-23 | This message got pushed so far so I just post it here again.
Note: for ppc questions please ask in <#1224760938616459304> 
I want to use this channel to collect feedback to improve the tool. Thank you guys.

  - 2024-11-28 | Yeah let's do that
  - 2024-11-28 | I think you need to add color name for the one below
  - 2024-11-28 | check on amazon.com
  - 2024-11-28 | are the listings still connected of being separated?
  - 2024-11-27 | Just make a new one and combine the 2 children again this time make sure the new parent has correct info
  - 2024-11-27 | Are u trying to change the old parent?
  - 2024-11-27 | Is that the old one that got the violation?
  - 2024-11-27 | Make sure to do it right next time
  - 2024-11-27 | You just need to keep creating the new parent
  - 2024-11-27 | It's still stuck in there but it's separated on the amazon site
  - 2024-11-27 | Yes
  - 2024-11-26 | You can try again but let's hop on a call with an amazon rep to have them look over and verify it first be fore conbining
  - 2024-11-26 | Make sure the parent matches the attribute of those 2 asins
  - 2024-11-26 | Read the bullets they give you
  - 2024-11-26 | It says removed mean they're been separated
  - 2024-11-24 | Sure no worries üëåüèª
  - 2024-11-23 | Then fill out the info required in red you should see them combined after that
  - 2024-11-23 | The goal is to combine the asins together
  - 2024-11-23 | It will create 2 extra skus for the 2 asins but you don't need to sell under those 2 new skus
  - 2024-11-23 | Use  different SKUs
  - 2024-11-23 | We just need to add the items in that bucket now
  - 2024-11-23 | The parent lising is the bucket that's all it does
  - 2024-11-23 | Think of it this way: you have 2 items that needed to be in the same bucket
  - 2024-11-23 | Note: you must keep title, bullets and everything from all listings to be the same to prevent they getting splitted later
  - 2024-11-23 | Then send me screenshot of that tab
  - 2024-11-23 | Toggle it on and go to variation tab
  - 2024-11-23 | You should see a button say "does this product have variation"
  - 2024-11-23 | Now create a new one and send me screenshot at the creation stage
  - 2024-11-23 | Okay cool
  - 2024-11-22 | They will combine all the reviews together
  - 2024-11-22 | Meet me for step 2
  - 2024-11-22 | You can create shipment and send supplier fnsku when step 1 is done no need to wait until they are connected
  - 2024-11-22 | Step 1: create an entire new listing for the new color
Step 2: create a placeholder listing (parent) (turn on the variation button) and connect the listing in step 1 and the old one together
  - 2024-11-22 | Ok
  - 2024-11-22 | Send me some screenshots
  - 2024-11-22 | Second what do you have on your inventory rn
  - 2024-11-22 | Ok first tell me what you need to have

  - 2024-10-25 | is the information updated successfully?
  - 2024-10-25 | if it's active then you're good, and yes close the listing
  - 2024-10-25 | the warning is to tell you to update some missing information, just go to edit and put the info in
  - 2024-10-25 | but that should be easy
  - 2024-10-25 | you may need to reupload images and bullets etc.

  - 2024-10-23 | You can ship the remaining to your house then ship it back in amazon later
  - 2024-12-13 | @AliceSvensson  "Super happy I could join class today, thanks for a intresting class.  Just one question... I know that you often dosent recommend launching the product in differens variations or colours. Is it much more difficult? Should I go with just one colour to start with? Even if I think that it will add more value to my offer if I can sell my product in different colours?" 
Launching variations is possible but it requires more work and capital invested, which is why we don't recommend unless there's a strong reason that makes it make sense
we can always add more variation later if needed
but again, it depends, we can't launch a shirt with just size Medium
But generally speaking, your first product is better to just have 1 variation because you still need time to learn and having multiple variations will just make it harder

  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-09 | With that being said, find a way to elevate your offer to make it more appealing than other guys
  - 2024-12-09 | It's a UPC code.
Yes you need one since a similar product is on amazon but it's not under your brand that means the one under you brand is a different on even though both have no difference. That's basically the definition of private label
  - 2024-11-10 | Can you send the analysis sheet for this one?
  - 2024-11-09 | ik it's a bit discouraging but I rather let you go slow than pursue something that is not worth the effort with high risk of failure
  - 2024-11-09 | we can make exception if the market is super potential which is rare
  - 2024-11-09 | yeah usually fragile products are no-gos for beginners
  - 2024-10-12 | <@1054411267340763216> Please send Alice the google calendar here
  - 2024-10-10 | <@1292032925964959755> here's your private message channel
  - 2024-12-04 | or just hire a highschooler or sth
  - 2024-12-04 | I hire a guy myself usually pay per hour, you can contact some 3Pl around your area
  - 2024-11-26 | Or give them access to your discord account to ask in here
  - 2024-11-26 | Hmm i'd say have someone at home monitor it for you. Come up with a check list and what to do in case soemthing happen
  - 2024-11-25 | That is correct
  - 2024-11-25 | If yes u can turn off the old one if you want
  - 2024-11-25 | Did you link the new link to qrcode?
  - 2024-11-25 | Duplicate the automation flow into a new one
  - 2024-11-25 | Can you duplicate the flow and change the link to the qrcode?
  - 2024-11-24 | Hmm but when you test it works?
  - 2024-11-24 | Do some minor edit it will appear
  - 2024-11-22 | you can input negative number now
  - 2024-11-22 | I fix the form
  - 2024-11-21 | Just put those in other
Every product is different so I don't think there's a problem tho. Amazon sometimes give discount on referrl fee that's why some people don't have it but it doesn't mean they won't have it forever
  - 2024-11-11 | can you unpublish and republish again
  - 2024-11-11 | hmm your logic looks correct
  - 2024-11-11 | you may wanna chekc the condition there
  - 2024-11-11 | hmm did they click your "leave review" button?
  - 2024-10-28 | done, check your email
  - 2024-10-28 | please watch module 5, go to where I adjust the keyword bid to export the csv
  - 2024-10-28 | export the data from the keyword bid(targeting) page not on the ad group page
  - 2024-10-28 | <@1213271303327453305> check your ppc assistant request you download the wrong sheet
  - 2024-10-15 | it works for me I just scanned it
  - 2024-12-11 | As long as you can put up with it I have no problem
  - 2024-12-11 | Okay nothing wrong with trying
  - 2024-12-11 | So there may be still some work there with the requirements
  - 2024-12-11 | The thing is the category is for kids
  - 2024-12-11 | That may trigger the same issue back then
  - 2024-12-11 | Be careful of using sensitive words
  - 2024-12-11 | With the new listing creation now
  - 2024-12-11 | I just need more context since what we last spoken confused me a bit
  - 2024-12-11 | It's ok
  - 2024-12-11 | Generic won't give you that
  - 2024-12-11 | It gives you A+ content
  - 2024-12-11 | If you can still use the brand them why not
  - 2024-12-11 | What's the issue with the brand? Is it removed from sellercentral?
  - 2024-12-11 | Have you tried create a listing with your brand name on?
  - 2024-12-11 | Did you withdraw them?
  - 2024-12-11 | Those units stuck in the old listing right?
  - 2024-12-11 | Are we gonna try to sell it on amazon?
  - 2024-12-11 | Tell me what's your plan is
  - 2024-10-17 | 1000 is a bit too much stay under 500. If neccessary you can skip box design first batch
  - 2024-10-14 | Composition: Lithium Ion
Regulation: Not applicable
  - 2024-10-14 | apply for GTIN exemption
  - 2024-10-10 | You can do it now no need waiting for supplier
  - 2024-10-10 | The goal is to see is there any requirements for that product
  - 2024-10-10 | And model number is basically what you decide it to be so it doesn't really matter
  - 2024-10-10 | Dummy listing doesn't need to be correct 100%
  - 2024-10-10 | done
  - 2024-12-04 | change the original if needed
  - 2024-12-04 | ehh no it has to be exactly the same
  - 2024-12-04 | and other info as well
  - 2024-12-04 | but the text should be the same
  - 2024-12-04 | picture can be different
  - 2024-12-04 | then we can combine it with the original
  - 2024-12-04 | after you have that make sure it doesn't have any restriction
  - 2024-12-04 | with new UPC
  - 2024-12-04 | yes
  - 2024-12-04 | it should be almost exactly the same as the original (title, desc, keywords, etc)
  - 2024-12-04 | now create an entire new listing for the second variation
  - 2024-12-04 | ok keep that original one
  - 2024-12-04 | the original one
  - 2024-12-04 | is your main listing still up?
  - 2024-12-04 | ok let's do it again
  - 2024-12-04 | uh oh
  - 2024-12-04 | how did you create the variation
  - 2024-12-04 | let's ignore that amazon support part
  - 2024-12-04 | did you create a new listing then combine them?
  - 2024-12-04 | how did you do this part?
  - 2024-12-04 | download that form first
  - 2024-12-04 | if you can send some screenshots here I can help over text
  - 2024-12-04 | hey <@1168356026471436323>  did you book? I coudldn't make it today
  - 2024-12-03 | send me a reminder tmr afternoon
  - 2024-12-03 | Booking
https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/booking/sZzWsC5MEcbtRRfgawqU?user_id=tvtAHbbVDvky72E3b3rr 
let's schedule a time here, if I can free up some time tmr I'll lyk
  - 2024-11-30 | You can see download tab in there too
  - 2024-11-30 | Or go to Catalog > upload via file
  - 2024-11-30 | Follow that link they send you should see a Download tab
  - 2024-11-30 | Just download the form and see what's in it you can send some screenshots here we can schedule a call if needed to look over it tgt
  - 2024-11-30 | but it shouldn't be that hard
  - 2024-11-30 | download that file and see what's in it I never created variations via file before
  - 2024-11-30 | looks like they want you to submit via a file
  - 2024-11-11 | Well nothing wrong with negotiating for better price
  - 2024-11-11 | You have to keep up with returns if doing fbm
  - 2024-11-11 | And the volume is low so you can defo do that on your own
  - 2024-11-11 | I think for now you can try some fbm to get farmiliar with it before using a 3PL
  - 2024-11-07 | Also give that new one some time start slowly
  - 2024-11-07 | Slow it down focus on the one that works
  - 2024-11-05 | Hmm I thought you do pretty good? Are you tryna scale?
  - 2024-11-13 | You can update tracking# yes
  - 2024-10-29 | this doesn't look like tracking ID but FBA ID
  - 2024-10-15 | usually Macy gives the best price
  - 2024-10-15 | that's probably not the final number just an estimate amount
  - 2024-10-14 | that looks correct
  - 2024-10-10 | should be ok, it's about the pace. Make it seems realistic
  - 2024-10-10 | Booking
https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/booking/sZzWsC5MEcbtRRfgawqU?user_id=tvtAHbbVDvky72E3b3rr
  - 2024-10-10 | There may be some changes on manychat
  - 2024-10-10 | Let's save our time on dm by a quick call?
  - 2024-11-20 | you should see an email by now i did it this morning
  - 2024-11-18 | drop 1 sheet per 1 "Attach file"
  - 2024-11-18 | 
  - 2024-11-18 | if they have the same then just repeat
  - 2024-11-18 | because you may have different target acos for each sheet
  - 2024-11-18 | if you have more than 5 you can do another submission
  - 2024-11-18 | I leave 5 sections for you
  - 2024-11-18 | Thy, the sheets look good but can you submit 1 sheet per section?
  - 2024-11-18 | can you send me one sheet you downloaded from one campaign here
  - 2024-11-18 | or Amazon may have changed it
  - 2024-11-18 | the columns should look something like this
  - 2024-11-18 | 
  - 2024-11-18 | if you have multiple files just upload multiple files
  - 2024-11-18 | the tool needs to look at what is exactly generated originally from Amazon to understand
  - 2024-11-18 | the column Keyword has "- exact" for example
  - 2024-11-18 | I saw you combine multiple files into one?
  - 2024-11-17 | <@1212159958976827482> just got your ppc assistant request, please submit again don't change anything on the downloaded files, submit the files as they are
  - 2024-11-12 | Yeah it shouldn't be a big issue just don't repeat that too often
  - 2024-11-08 | you have to delete the listing and relist to update it
  - 2024-11-08 | there is but since you just launch let's not do it now
  - 2024-10-21 | yes
  - 2024-10-11 | smh
  - 2024-10-11 | what the hell is that
  - 2024-10-11 | former ghost writer in action
  - 2024-10-11 | I usually not really care if they leave bad review but since your brand is new let's not risk it lol
  - 2024-10-11 | ok so maybe just cut loss then lol
  - 2024-10-11 | lol
  - 2024-10-11 | 1 star amazon review?
  - 2024-10-11 | what can he do?
  - 2024-10-11 | but if you think the amount is not worth it then it's ok to cut loss but I don't like this guy based on what you provided
  - 2024-10-11 | not really, if you pay through paypal they will just withdraw his money if he can't prove that he fulfill the work
  - 2024-10-11 | gather all the email
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah let's dsipute it
  - 2024-10-11 | did you pay via "service" or "friend and family"
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah you can dispute it on paypal
  - 2024-10-11 | <@728408607510626444>  here
  - 2024-12-09 | Usually 2 weeks is recommended if you concern about ad spend just reduce your budget and set lower target
  - 2024-12-09 | I optimized both anyways
  - 2024-11-20 | yeah let's add the rest in
  - 2024-10-29 | your margin is already super low right now, I don't think dropping price is a good option
  - 2024-10-29 | result sent
  - 2024-10-29 | we can try to boost ppc but it may be very expensive
  - 2024-10-28 | I'm not mentioning anything about generating keywords
  - 2024-10-28 | go to the targeting tab on the campaign(where you see all the keywords) to download the csv
  - 2024-10-28 | no the sheet you used to submit the second form was wrong
  - 2024-10-25 | you have to go to where the keywords are to export
  - 2024-10-25 | for ppc assistant
  - 2024-10-25 | <@809813064756887582> the sheet in the second form you uploaded is not correct
  - 2024-10-23 | Looks good I'll send the result soon
  - 2024-10-21 | yed
  - 2024-10-19 | Hey brother did you book 2 slot on Tuesday?
  - 2024-10-18 | Just optimize like normal, submit the form
  - 2024-10-15 | But well you can use the one Susan sent
  - 2024-10-15 | You have to duplicate it
  - 2024-10-15 | It'll be different for everyone instead use ppc tracker along with pppc assistant and practice with ppc homework
  - 2024-10-15 | And you don't need that sheet in the video there it's just to demonstrate the idea don't apply the formula
  - 2024-10-15 | It's not that one, find the ppc tracker video
  - 2024-11-19 | Yeah google the closest one to you to get sn estimate but the exact one will be when you create the shipment
  - 2024-12-09 | I plan to make it a better tool that can remember each person numbers and make better optimization each time
  - 2024-12-09 | I don't wanna expose it to everyone yet just for Yellow members for now
  - 2024-12-09 | <#1266234579501580320> it's in here
  - 2024-12-09 | I suggest if you see a person don't know what they're doing, let's tell them to just use ppc-assistant while practice more ob ppc homework. Telling them phrases like "cut bleeders" will just confuse them <@308107877493768193> <@297667891992723457> 
For Tam, it's a hard case, 10% margin before ppc is just too little. He'll be in red for a while unless he can increase his margin somehow.
  - 2024-12-07 | all good now
  - 2024-12-07 | hey <@308107877493768193> we met already, it was my bad setting the alarm 1 hour late
  - 2024-12-03 | can you tell him to ask in his private channel going forward so the team aware?
  - 2024-12-03 | Tam is charging is ppc through seller acct

  - 2024-10-13 | I will adjust it for you
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1196333933814612000> you set target too low
  - 2024-10-13 | I'll run the optimization for you in a bit
  - 2024-10-13 | Auto looks decent which is a good sign
  - 2024-10-13 | Just send the link to your tracker no need screenshot actually
  - 2024-10-13 | Ah I see we may bid too low
  - 2024-10-13 | Send a screenshot of your ppc tracker here
  - 2024-10-13 | I'll look at your ppc request
  - 2024-10-13 | By performing you mean spend with no sale or just low spend?
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1196333933814612000> here
  - 2024-11-04 | Reach out to us and give me some weekly activities to keep you accountable
  - 2024-10-28 | but you can consult with Justin on this to see what's his opinion is
  - 2024-10-28 | Since it's your first product, I'm leaning toward the later. Take a bit more time to find a better market with less restriction while building up your experience with Amazon
  - 2024-10-28 | on the other hand, staying away from this market can save you a lot of headache later down the road
  - 2024-10-28 | It's a bit hard to give the right answer in this case, as moving forward with that supplier inherit some risk, but of course it'll continue your progress with less disruption
  - 2024-10-21 | They had a system glitch a few dys ago
  - 2024-10-21 | Let's open an appeal under account health
  - 2024-10-21 | When you created the dummy listing tryna void sensitive words I think Minh has a word list to stay away fron <@1054411267340763216>
  - 2024-10-21 | Ah this is a common issue but it may get tricky
  - 2024-10-19 | what's the issue that makes them inactice?
  - 2024-11-18 | but aim to lower it if you can
  - 2024-11-18 | 10% is not too bad for electronics
  - 2024-11-15 | yeah do that
  - 2024-11-15 | I though it's like $10 increase
  - 2024-11-15 | let's just do 99.99
  - 2024-11-15 | ah ok not much
  - 2024-11-15 | remind me about that I'll do it during class
  - 2024-11-15 | check your keyword ranking using helium10 listing analizer (I may need to do a tutorial)

  - 2024-12-03 | it's from Olesia, you can ask her for more details
  - 2024-12-03 | https://www.fiverr.com/s/xXj3jDQ
  - 2024-12-03 | yes let me ask for you
  - 2024-12-03 | let's use a fiverr service to resolve it
  - 2024-12-03 | your listing may contains some keyword that trigger the violation
  - 2024-11-09 | Keep it simple,
  - 2024-11-09 | Wait until the new stock coming and turn everything back on to where they were before
  - 2024-11-09 | But unless you're running out of stock
  - 2024-11-09 | It's like starting over
  - 2024-11-09 | Don't turn off anything keep the originals
  - 2024-11-09 | if you not sure what target ACOS to give to the assistant just post your ppc tracker here I can give suggestion
  - 2024-11-09 | to make it easier, bring it back up to where it was before, every 2 weeks do ppc tracker and use ppc assistant
  - 2024-11-09 | which explains why your sale is sinking
  - 2024-11-09 | you can monitor every but don't adjust it too often or your listing will slowly die
  - 2024-11-09 | even couple days still over optimizing
  - 2024-11-09 | instagram: use meta business and schedule posts. You can spend a day to schedule 30 posts a month
  - 2024-11-09 | fbm reviews: not that hard just write a bunch of reviews in advance
  - 2024-11-09 | ppc you only optimize once every 2 weeks, don't tell me you optimize everyday?
  - 2024-11-08 | give me 3 things that take up the most of your time (from Amazon)
  - 2024-11-08 | other than that just monitor your account 15min a day, you don't need a VA now
  - 2024-11-08 | well, you can keep things minimal with ppc assistant once every 2 weeks
  - 2024-11-08 | Hi <@1213335800205414452> sorry missed your text
  - 2024-10-23 | Yes you can but should you?

  - 2024-11-25 | hey Lowell any update?
  - 2024-10-30 | for ppc optimization, 
1. Look at ppc homework 1 and do about 20-50 keywords
2. Compare with the result
3. If you don't get most of it right -> use ppc assistant as your optimization tool while you're practice more
  - 2024-10-30 | also, navigate to homeowork and do Data visibility homework and send that to me as well
  - 2024-10-30 | can you watch ppc tracker and fill that out and send it to me?
  - 2024-10-30 | What's high ACOS? 100%?
  - 2024-10-30 | Have you been doing homework? and use our trackers/tools?
  - 2024-10-30 | Hey <@1213522117304520774>, it's been a few weeks since launch, just checking in to see how you doing?
  - 2024-11-20 | Next time it'll work
  - 2024-11-20 | That's what I was suspecting
  - 2024-11-20 | Did you wait?
  - 2024-11-15 | Delete and wait mean you removing it from Amazon catalog
  - 2024-11-15 | No download the one say: Add the one NOT in Amazon catalog
  - 2024-11-15 | Make sure to use microsoft excel
  - 2024-11-15 | When you choose the product type it should show the red boxes
  - 2024-11-15 | All red ones are needed
  - 2024-11-15 | let's delete and do it again this time send me screenshot of the sheet first before uploading
  - 2024-11-15 | also did you mark Update under Update/Delete column?
  - 2024-11-15 | don't fill the whole thing
  - 2024-11-15 | just fill out the red outlined ones
  - 2024-11-15 | usually we don't need to fill out the inventory part
  - 2024-11-13 | and upload the file
  - 2024-11-13 | wait at least 24 hours
  - 2024-11-13 | then delete it
  - 2024-11-13 | then take some screenshot from the listing jsut in case
  - 2024-11-13 | it's safe to download and fill out the sheet first make sure everything correct
  - 2024-11-13 | ok then back to the deleting and reuploading method
  - 2024-11-13 | that's why I'm asking do you have to use that one
  - 2024-11-13 | then you must use the same ASIN then
  - 2024-11-13 | if it's still the same ASIN then it's not gonna work
  - 2024-11-13 | you can tryI'm not sure what you mean by copy
  - 2024-11-13 | it's much easier that way
  - 2024-11-13 | well then just create a new one if you haven't done anything with that old one
  - 2024-11-13 | you're not selling on that listing right
  - 2024-11-13 | no need to delete you can just leave it there
  - 2024-11-13 | then just create a new one tho
  - 2024-11-13 | do you HAVE TO use that same listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | that sheet is tricky lmk if you got stuck
  - 2024-11-13 | fill the ones outlined in red color
  - 2024-11-13 | anything that has the arrow must be picked not typed in
  - 2024-11-13 | fill out the template: you must use Microsoft Excel for this
  - 2024-11-13 | download the template in Catalog -> Upload via file -> Download template
  - 2024-11-13 | do what I suggest, screenshot all the detail inside your listing first

  - 2024-12-13 | yeah this never happens before
  - 2024-12-11 | can you do it again submit what is downloaded from amazon don't change anything

  - 2024-11-02 | regarding homework, you should find it on the vault or in <#1277732114623893636>
  - 2024-11-02 | Hi <@851966379971706880> this is your private channel
  - 2024-11-17 | can you make one?
  - 2024-11-16 | this market is getting saturated fast
  - 2024-11-16 | do you have the market analysis sheet?
  - 2024-11-16 | <@1218354786257076335> can you send your questions and product here, let's communicate here instead of dms
  - 2024-12-06 | 1. numbers are relative, you can prepare the sheet for Minh to check
2. it requires more work but doable, just make sure it's potential enough to take the risk
3. you can start llc, biz cc can be later after you find a potential product
  - 2024-12-01 | If it aids you on product research you can keep it otherwise we don't require anything beside Helium10
  - 2024-12-01 | What are the other 2 for? Product research?
  - 2024-11-30 | Yes you can do that to save fee now just remember to switch it later
  - 2024-12-12 | Your response looks good let's use that
  - 2024-12-12 | You're very close
  - 2024-12-12 | As far ad the insert card image you can keep it there in case they ask no need to send them just yet
  - 2024-12-12 | Yes just give them the information they wanted
  - 2024-12-12 | good response, try to get in contact with them if possible to elevate your case
  - 2024-12-11 | Worst case we just with draw the inventory and resend it back
  - 2024-12-11 | Give them a call and don't admit it
  - 2024-12-11 | Yeah I went back a forth a few times
  - 2024-12-11 | They trying to get you admit it
  - 2024-12-11 | Can you give them a call
  - 2024-12-11 | the first one there
  - 2024-12-11 | yes
  - 2024-12-11 | look closer
  - 2024-12-11 | you can remove fulfillable units
  - 2024-12-11 | you can send just the qrcode
  - 2024-12-11 | no don't send them anything other than what I told you to
  - 2024-12-11 | hopefully they don't question that review
  - 2024-12-11 | I think it's ok
  - 2024-12-11 | the goal is to let them lift the violation without removing all of your inventory
  - 2024-12-11 | yeah it might that's why we include the withdrawal part
  - 2024-12-11 | take the screenshot of your message to him
  - 2024-12-11 | yeah you could explain that if Amazon question you
  - 2024-12-11 | it ok you can skip the insert card image
  - 2024-12-11 | And put the withdrawal order id on there
  - 2024-12-11 | Just say you withdraw inventory
  - 2024-12-11 | For corrective action 1 don't say 50 units
  - 2024-12-11 | Okay continue writing the 2 letters
  - 2024-12-11 | Now use your fb acct to scan and take screenshots
  - 2024-12-11 | That works
  - 2024-12-11 | Cool
  - 2024-12-11 | 
  - 2024-12-11 | The put it here
  - 2024-12-11 | Go on Canva and make a warranty image and put you logo on it
  - 2024-12-11 | So it makes sense when you write the appeal letter
  - 2024-12-11 | So that you position the warranty as the offer on the actual insert card
  - 2024-12-11 | You can say
Here's your Lifetime Warranty (worth $10 to purchase separately)....
  - 2024-12-11 | Delete anything related to review
  - 2024-12-11 | Change this part to offer just warranty
  - 2024-12-11 | Yes
  - 2024-12-11 | Then do step 3-7
  - 2024-12-11 | And republish it
  - 2024-12-11 | In your flow
  - 2024-12-11 | Cut it from here
  - 2024-12-11 | 
  - 2024-12-11 | Only leave the first messge of warranty
  - 2024-12-11 | Leave it open but unlink the messages that have "review"
  - 2024-12-11 | No switching it off
  - 2024-12-11 | No
  - 2024-12-11 | Do what I just said
  - 2024-12-11 | It's unlikely there's a detective or anyone checking your flow
  - 2024-12-11 | Again do not admit anything
  - 2024-12-11 | It's to prepared for this
  - 2024-12-02 | Hey brother, I can take it from here regarding your continuation in the program.
  - 2024-12-05 | I know you can do this, don't give up yet

  - 2024-12-05 | I'm not launched yet, but happy to help with FBM
  - 2024-11-30 | I was looking for this one! Thank you very much
  - 2024-11-30 | I can choose any warehouse? How do I link the shipping/warehouse to my inventory listing? They have to follow the tracking somehow right?
  - 2024-11-30 | They are ready to ship and I need to give my supplier the shipping address
  - 2024-11-30 | Do I need to do anything with my product listing to ensure it is going to the correct warehouse?
  - 2024-11-30 | Thank you! How do you know which one to select? I was reading that you should send to 5 different ones for the best optimization? Do I randomly pick 5 or does Amazon choose for me? I was heading from other students that West side fulfillment centers are cheaper?
  - 2024-11-29 | Hello, where can you find the addresses of the Amazon warehouses to ship to? My supplier is asking where to ship it but I can't found the addresses
  - 2024-11-21 | Question, is there a general inspection checklist anywhere? Or do we make our own?
  - 2024-11-21 | The answer is yes, and I submitted the form on Alibaba lol.
  - 2024-11-21 | Do we pay taxes on our orders from china? I googled it and it says we need a resale exemption? And we‚Äôll typically need to provide Alibaba with a valid resale certificate. How do we get one?
  - 2024-11-20 | What is the typical payment for bulk orders? Do you pay everything up front? That's a relatively large payment. Or is it split 50/50 half now half when order is received? Or payment plans?
  - 2024-11-19 | Thank you! Is there a way for me to access all the documents? They're not included in the videos and I'm not sure where to find these written instructions
  - 2024-11-19 | Under Module 2 Part 3: I think it's missing the IP accelerator video? I'm watching the "How to Apply for you Brand Registry" video and it said we already covered the IP accelerator but I didn't see it. Where can I find the IP accelerator instructions? When I go there all I see is this:

  - 2024-11-20 | What is the typical payment for bulk orders? Do you pay everything up front? That's a relatively large payment. Or is it split 50/50 half now half when order is received? Or payment plans?
  - 2024-11-19 | Thank you! Is there a way for me to access all the documents? They're not included in the videos and I'm not sure where to find these written instructions
  - 2024-11-19 | Under Module 2 Part 3: I think it's missing the IP accelerator video?

  - 2024-12-05 | And if so, how much is reasonable to pay?
  - 2024-12-05 | If we have addon items to our product and we ship the addon items to the main product factory, I have to ask my supplier to add them into all the product orders and boxes, do I have to pay them extra for this extra work?

  - 2024-12-03 | I've had a series of tough weeks with my health. I've had a bad cough for over a month now. Ever since my 4yo started school for the first time, I don't remember what it's like to feel healthy or even relatively normal.  Lol! I've heard from others that they've had similar experience. 
It's been a while since I've posted here. I'm currently talking with Macy about finding a supplier. I'm a bit torn bc the supplier is requiring MOQ of 1000 w/all the customization I'm hoping to beat the competition with. This is well above my means. I'm looking into building my credit to help but hoping I'm not digging more of a hole I can't get out of. I will see what I can do but wondering if I can get her to help me with just MOQ of 500.

  - 2024-09-26 | Help Vietnam‚Äôs Storm Yagi Victims:
Let‚Äôs Do More Together!

What Happened?
Storm Yagi hit Vietnam with devastating force, leaving entire communities in ruins. Heavy rains and winds displaced thousands, flooding homes and destroying vital infrastructure. Many families are now left without shelter, food, or access to medical care. The destruction is widespread, with entire villages submerged under water and roads washed away. The storm has created a humanitarian crisis, and immediate relief is critical to help these communities rebuild and recover. Your support can bring hope to those affected by this disaster.

How Can We Help?


Dear AMZ Shifu family,

We‚Äôve already donated $4,000 to aid the victims of Storm Yagi in Vietnam, but the need is still overwhelming. Thousands of families have lost their homes and are in urgent need of support. We‚Äôre now reaching out to our incredible community to join us in making a bigger difference.

Even a small contribution can go a long way in providing food, shelter, and medical aid. Let‚Äôs stand together to help those in need.

Please donate today: https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/PW6NVEZZ2H3SN
Organization: https://www.khbetterfuture.org/

Thank you for your kindness and generosity!
With gratitude,

Justin & Charlie

  - 2024-01-16 | Hi everyone

@Christopher Villanueva  is trying to raise funds to finish equipping his new tutoring hall he has created in the Philippines to help all the kids in that small village. He has listed items on the fundraiser that we need to still purchase to begin enrollment in February, so we are hoping to receive all funds before then.

Also, any person donating $500 or more will be considered a founding sponsor and will have their name placed on a permanent plaque on the building.

I think this is a good time to give back, to help more and more people and a fresh start for 2024. For any additional information, feel free to ask here or send Christopher a message.

  - 2024-12-10 | Hi <@173853354374463489> ,

We have a new tutorial that explains how to get brand approval without needing to go through the trademark and brand registry process. This method can save you both time and money!

Please take a moment to watch the tutorial video in Shifu Vault, and we've also included written instructions for your convenience. Let me know if you have any questions!
  - 2024-10-17 | You should negotiate to lower the MOQ down a bit , and ask them if you are able to pay for the customization
  - 2024-10-17 | In my opinion, it‚Äôs very important 
A nice packaging design will make your listing looks better, and you will also use it to make contents for social media + influencer marketing
  - 2024-10-16 | The goal for your first launching is to test out the market and to optimize your product 
After you sold out, you will gather all of the feedback from customers to improve your product.
1000 units is a high number, and I suggest to do around 200 to 300 for your first launching <@173853354374463489>
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you Shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-14 | Your supplier will have all of the battery information <@173853354374463489> please communicate with them
  - 2024-10-13 | How are you doing <@173853354374463489> ?

Here is the loom recording for your product analysis : https://www.loom.com/share/d91e6d529dae419b8e1cf0c8c12dfb37
  - 2024-10-14 | Yes there is a new tutorial video how to create shipping label 2024 update in Shifu Vault 

Amazon will tell you which location you need to ship them to, just create the shipping label and they will give you the warehouse ID <@1256245998255345695>
  - 2024-10-14 | You can reach out to both Macy and Alibaba at the same time sis, compare the price and go after the one saves more money for you. In the past couple months we have some members went with Alibaba inspection and it was good üëç 

Here is the inspection checklist üòä

https://glistening-raincoat-575.notion.site/Inspection-Check-List-c36ba1e7c5fc48b292b658eee69ca863?pvs=4
  - 2024-11-19 | Tell them you will provide the address whenever they are done with the production 

You will need the shipping boxes dimensions to create shipping labels
  - 2024-10-29 | Hi <@505081578247159830> usually you will need to wait a couple hours so the UPC you've purchased will be verified in Amazon system, let me know if you still have the same issue in the next 3 hours
  - 2024-10-21 | Great job on this one <@505081578247159830> , yes please continue on your product research
  - 2024-10-21 | I saw the link Hannah 
It's a Wireless Car stereo-compatible

We don't recommend this market :
1. This category has a high return rate compared with other category
2. This category is very competitive, new sellers are trying to undercut pricing, and you also will get attacks from CN sellers
3. We experienced a higher rate of having Hijacker in this category
  - 2024-10-21 | https://www.loom.com/share/e0f2dac3b1ed40719fe43501abbc757f
  - 2024-10-21 | let me know if you have any questions
Again, confirm with me whenever you are done with your profit calculation sheet, we need to make sure it's more than 30% üòä
  - 2024-10-21 | Thank you sis <@505081578247159830> just want to make sure it's not in the Car-Electric category

Good job on this one, you can start on module #2
1. Create a dummy listing for this product
2. Practice communicating with your supplier
3. Work on your profit calculation sheet: make sure it's more than 30%

  - 2024-12-09 | That is awesome! I'll keep everyone posted on update when I hear back from Amazon
  - 2024-12-09 | No. I don't believe so. I've never had to submit one or Amazon has never asked for one
  - 2024-12-09 | Oh gosh, I hope this issue doesn't take me that long üôà
  - 2024-12-09 | Thank you!
  - 2024-12-09 | I believe I used the wrong word when I replied to a seller feedback. A couple of days after i posted the reply, Amazon classified my product as a laser product.
  - 2024-12-09 | Thank you!
  - 2024-12-08 | Bump in the road: My product got removed from Amazon but currently working on getting it back! üí™üèª

  - 2024-12-11 | 1. Everything in life is happening FOR you NOT to you. All the "negative" experiences you're life was meant as a learning experience and how you can grow from it. 

2. If you're in head, you're deadüíÄ your negative thoughts are just your thoughts and no one else's. When you are in your thoughts, they are all assumptions and not facts. Example: "Im never going to find a winning productüò≠ ". You will find that winning product if you have determination and focus. 

3. Problems need energy to live. If you feed energy to a problem, it would continue to exist. If you don't, then the problem magically disappearsüôÉ

  - 2024-10-13 | Product research phase is not easy for sure guys. It took me 2-3 months of constant searching putting in 1-3 hours everyday. It will all be worth it when you find your potential product. Reverse lookup on Alibaba. Look on TikTok #tiktokmademebuyit, Brookstone, IG, Just to name a few. Look on other big company website and see what they are selling. Keep browsing around. Trust the process and don't lose faith! You got this! üí™üèº

It‚Äôs been a while since I last shared an update. The past few weeks have been challenging for me. I‚Äôve been struggling to manage my schedule while juggling school, work, and family issues. After a call with Shifu <@975774205658411068>  , I realized that my main challenge is time management. To address this, I‚Äôve started dedicating two hours late at night to watch class recordings, especially on PPC. I‚Äôve also been reaching out to other mentees for support, and fortunately, they‚Äôve been incredibly helpful. I look at amz seller board, I‚Äôve come to understand that if I don‚Äôt stay focused and spend time, I won‚Äôt see the results I‚Äôm aiming for.

  - 2024-12-02 | I have a same question. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  - 2024-10-10 | Thu Nguyen - thunguyen0056
  - 2024-11-29 | I‚Äôm concerned because Amazon has blocked my listing a couple of times when I updated images, changes descriptions or uploaded a video. üôà
  - 2024-11-29 | thank you sis! üòÅ
  - 2024-11-29 | could I add video of an influencer from Tiktok to my listing AMZ? a video is unboxing of product. anything about copy right?
  - 2024-11-30 | could i increase my budget each ppc? it is out of budget around 3 pm cst.
  - 2024-11-29 | hi Han, i resubmit ppc.
  - 2024-08-19 | I remember from the tutorial that if the budget runs out in the afternoon, around 3-4 pm, should I increase the budget, or should I wait and optimize after two weeks?
  - 2024-12-13 | Because the supplier only allows MOQ 1000 units to get brand name and custom box. could i sell the product without brand name in amz?
  - 2024-12-03 | thanks Han!
  - 2024-12-03 | have you recommend anyone?
  - 2024-12-03 | how can i resolve this problem? i was not sure why it happened?
  - 2024-11-09 | thank you Han! I will do it . I feel better now. I'm struggling in last couple weeks. It overload to me.
  - 2024-11-09 | So could I find a new keywords or still keep the old one? I haven't turn off auto and ultimate yet.
  - 2024-11-09 | I just concern that I take a look ppc in 2 weeks feel lost much money and don't get sales. üôà
  - 2024-11-09 | So I can turn on ppc again when the inventory full?
  - 2024-11-09 | i don't optimize every day. in couple days, i take a look if keywords didn't make sales I will bids down or turn off.
  - 2024-11-09 | So, I don't keep in my eyes in ppc, it looks like spending much money but not sales. That's a reason I need someone ppc assitant in short term.
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi Han, 3 things are ppc, fbm review and post instagram in single day.
  - 2024-11-07 | Hi Han, how are you doing? Susan suggested me DM you to help. honestly  I am focus in my last semester to complete Master degree. My inventory is low. I turn off my ppc last week. The second bulk is in bound. Honestly I don't spend time in ppc much. Could I hire someone to take care of it for black Friday sales? Please advise, I'm a bit stressed now.
  - 2024-11-07 | Oh ok I will DM to Han. Thanks Susan!
  - 2024-11-07 | My inventory is low. I turn off my ppc last week. The second bulk is in bound. Honestly I don't spend time in ppc much. Could I hire someone to take care of it for black Friday sales? Please advise, I'm a bit stressed now.
  - 2024-11-07 | Hello, honestly  I am focus in my last semester to complete Master degree. I don't have time to join the class. Sorry about unconvinced. I need advice right now.
  - 2024-10-30 | can i send the spreadsheet to airtable to optimize ppc?
  - 2024-10-30 | Do I to research new key words in ppc for second bulk order?

  - 2024-12-11 | Hi Tom! I just booked a meeting for next Friday at 1pm cst. I look forward to chatting with you then.
  - 2024-12-11 | Hi Minh & Han, I have too much going on in my personal life that I don‚Äôt think I can find time to dedicate to this program anymore unfortunately. I know it sounds silly, but I want to withdraw from the program and focus more on what I‚Äôm currently doing (real estate) and get really good at that before I try something else (this). Maybe I‚Äôll come back to this later, maybe not. But as of right now, I need to be honest with myself and focus on one thing.
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Anh Minh! Will do. I thought that training was on Fridays.

(SUNDAY FULLY REST)

Check-in here to let us know how close you were to the goals you set at the beginning of this week to receive accountability coaching/support to move the needle forward in your business. REMEMBER, you don't have to be perfect or hit all your goals week to week.  As long as you are 1% more than the week before, that's what matters This journey is a marathon, not a sprint! 
[do this each week] Answer the questions below:

A. Reflection: 
Are you able to hit the goals that you have set from the beginning of the week?
-If you have -> I want you to reward yourself with a treat (either eating at your fav restaurant or watching your fav movie) 
If you haven't -> I want you to still reward yourself with 50 squats /pushups, though, remember, at least you paid up and know that you can restart and get rid of the sense of guilt inside.
Reflect on what are the MAIN roadblocks/distractions from the previous week that you were facing. ( BE HONEST; WE ARE FAMILY. Share it and receive suggestions from those who have solved it)
What are the two possible solutions/actions that you will take to reduce/remove/replace these roadblocks or distractions so you can move closer to your goal?
-Share your MAIN WHYS to remind yourself of why you are on this journey. 

B.Planning next week's goal: 
What stage are you on this journey?
-What are your three main goals to focus on that will move the needle forward (the 20% that generate 80% results) ?
What support processes do you need to make that happen?

Check-in here to let us know how close you were to the goals you set at the beginning of this week to receive accountability coaching/support to move the needle forward in your business. REMEMBER, you don't have to be perfect or hit all your goals week to week.  As long as you are 1% more than the week before, that's what matters This journey is a marathon, not a sprint! 
[do this each week] Answer the questions below:

A. Reflection: 
Are you able to hit the goals that you have set from the beginning of the week?
-If you have -> I want you to reward yourself with a treat (either eating at your fav restaurant or watching your fav movie) 
If you haven't -> I want you to still reward yourself with 50 squats /pushups, though, remember, at least you paid up and know that you can restart and get rid of the sense of guilt inside.
Reflect on what are the MAIN roadblocks/distractions from the previous week that you were facing. ( BE HONEST; WE ARE FAMILY. Share it and receive suggestions from those who have solved it)
What are the two possible solutions/actions that you will take to reduce/remove/replace these roadblocks or distractions so you can move closer to your goal?
-Share your MAIN WHYS to remind yourself of why you are on this journey. 

B.Planning next week's goal: 
What stage are you on this journey?
-What are your three main goals to focus on that will move the needle forward (the 20% that generate 80% results) ?
What support processes do you need to make that happen?

Post below so we can follow up with you and help you move forward. If you don't post below, it will be hard for all of our coaches and support to check in with you. so do me a favor POST ‚ù§Ô∏è

What are your 3 advices that you wish you knew sooner in your 20-30? üëálet's share below
  - 2024-12-11 | I go first:

1. Only God see you through your heart, human see you through your skins. Dress well, behave well, work on your look and use your charm as it will attract more luck and people to help you & always smile!

2. Your life outcome can be changed when you adjust your life's lense.  One prisoner can see walls while the other one see the blue sky through his jail's window. 

3. Accept that big things are built by small efforts. The huge Paramyd are made with small blocks stacking on top. Your 1% habits will build bigger things over time!

  - 2024-12-11 | 
  - 2024-12-09 | The longer you wait, the more problems your head will creates.

It's its nature to protect you from harms, but Also limit you from your potential

Make a plan stick to it, execute
  - 2024-12-09 | ‚ÄúOverthinking steals your life, steals your happiness, and steals your smile.‚Äù

I know it hard! Learn to silient the voice with nature, practice, and take actions
  - 2024-12-09 | I dont mean to interrupt your scrolling but I just thought you should know....

Remember, you are over qualified than most people who ain‚Äôt trying and I‚Äôm proud of you for not giving up on yourself!

1. What God what done? What's your purpose if you don't live forever , who do you want to help? 
2. You will face a lot of rejection-> never give up. All you need is one yes
3. Positioning and INSIST on the opputunity. Never say no to anything that can promote your products , if Robert never left his book at the "high end" car wash after his friend decline , he won't have the amway ceo to promote that book to operas

4. stop making excuses and start saying more yes to oops that grow your biz : if Robert never flies back from his hunting trip > he will never be on Oprah

Why can't you be the one to stop generational trauma for your family?

Why not become the first millionaire in your lineage?

Why not help more people?

This isn't just about motivation-this is pure logic.

If you have one shot at this thing called life...
If you're unhappy with where you are...
If your loved ones need help...
If you're already carrying regret and guilt...

Then why not be the one to change it all?

I truly believe it not only can be you, but it must be you.üëá

  - 2024-11-19 | Takeaways from Tony‚Äôs Journey:

1. Persistence Pays Off
Tony didn‚Äôt stop at the first or even the fourth flop. Flier #5 was the game-changer. Most people give up too soon, but success often hides just one step further than you think.

2. Good Copywriting is Leverage
The difference between a dud and a hit wasn‚Äôt luck‚Äîit was the message. Tony understood his audience and crafted words that resonated. The right words can open doors, and in this case, flood a website.

3. Strategic Distribution is Everything
Tony didn‚Äôt just throw his fliers anywhere. He placed them near Amazon offices, where his target audience‚Äîand potential amplifiers‚Äîwere most likely to notice. Go where your customers already are.

4. Luck Favors Preparation
The Reddit post and Twitter virality weren‚Äôt accidents. They were the result of Tony‚Äôs groundwork. His success is a reminder that ‚Äúluck‚Äù is often a combination of effort and timing.

5. Creativity + Hustle = Opportunities
Tony didn‚Äôt have a big budget, a fancy website, or years of experience. What he had was hustle, creativity, and the willingness to try something different. Those ingredients can take you far.

6. The Power of Resilience
Imagine if Tony stopped at Flier #4. The difference between success and failure is often resilience in the face of rejection. Keep iterating and testing until you find what works.

The Lesson?

Great copy + smart distribution is the ultimate cheat code. And when paired with persistence, it‚Äôs game over for the competition.

Would you stop after your 4th flop? Or would you push for your own version of Flier #5?

@everyone
  - 2024-11-19 | The Flier blew up this guys biz & how you can blow up your biz, to bring sales üòÜ, not that boomboom 

Tony was just a broke Doordash driver with a dream and a printer. He made six versions of a flier for his delivery service.

Flier #1? Crickets.
Flier #2? Nope.
#3 and #4? Still nothing.

But Flier #5? That one hit.

Tony printed 300 copies, spent 4 days plastering them around Amazon‚Äôs Seattle office, and crossed his fingers. Day 4? Boom‚Äîit went viral on Reddit. Day 5? Twitter blew up.

Now Tony‚Äôs website is swamped, with backlinks from major sites.

1. Write down your Top 3 Priorities every morning (or the night before)

Nap strategically üò¥

  - 2023-12-28 | @everyone
  - 2024-12-13 | Another Travel tips for @everyone  this holiday when check in hotel.I always love Hyatt, have an account with them when booking. 

1. Always be nice smile, ask how the checkin agent days. It takes practice to be genuine and flow.

2. Ask if there's any complimentary upgrade available while sliding a $20-100 with a smile to take care of them. Have small little chat.

$20 you get complimentary extra services

$100: you may get suite upgrade 

->Got 3 days passs-  $45/person/day x2 person x 3 days bc i did the above. They sold out on suites
-> good investment win-win. Everyone happy 
<@1224111899873120308> since you requested it brother
  - 2024-12-13 | I agreed ü•≤. Not Dfw for SW lol
  - 2024-12-12 | I should work . But SW carries out in Dallas love field. Not DFW
  - 2024-12-12 | Lounge hack for Amazon digital nomads:

#senerios: i traveled from DFW -SFO to pick my mom up.
(Note: this work all airport in america with SE carrier)
She didn't landed until 8pm and I have already at the SFO.

Problem: I need food and a lounge work yet I don't have a next flight in order to have a boarding past to check in the lounge with my priority pass from Amex.

Solution: I booked a one way , same day 3-4 hours ahead flight from SFO - LAS with 

-Southwest (they are pretty easy on 24h cancellation no charge )

-once I checked in the lounge, I cancellled the flight.

Notes: do this at moderate frequencies. Don't overdo I would recommend 1-3 time max a year to avoid being terminated. 

Happy travel with your loved ones , Amazon warriors , for your holidays

  - 2024-04-15 | hi @everyone just updated : Module 2: SOURCING:
lesson: *HACK* Save time with sourcing agent:

ABOUT THIS LESSON
If time isn't your friend, I highly recommend hiring a sourcing agent to help you do all the communication with manufacturers so that it saves you time and Fastrack your progress.

A sourcing agent will represent you to do all the groundwork and this allows you to focus on the most important task which is product development and planning your marketing plan. A sourcing agent can also help you get different products and bundle them together for your main product.

To conclude, getting a sourcing agent is the fastest way to save time. It's an investment for long-term scalability and time-saving.

  - 2024-12-01 | --Improved Review 2: Finally, a Bottle That Lasts!
*"I‚Äôve owned a few hydrogen water bottles over the years, and durability has always been an issue for me. My last one, [competitor‚Äôs product], stopped working after just two months‚Äîsuper disappointing, especially given how much I paid for it.

This one, though, feels like it‚Äôs built to last. It‚Äôs sturdy and reliable, and after using it daily for a few months now, it still works perfectly. I will say it‚Äôs a little heavier than my old bottle, which makes it less convenient to carry around everywhere, but I‚Äôll take that trade-off for something that doesn‚Äôt break.

If you‚Äôre tired of wasting money on bottles that don‚Äôt hold up, I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving this one a shot. It‚Äôs worth it for the peace of mind alone."*

---Improved Review 3: Customer Support That Actually Helps
*"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but I had to for this one because the customer service stood out to me so much. My last bottle (from [competitor‚Äôs product]) had some issues, and trying to get in touch with their support team was a nightmare‚Äîthey basically ghosted me.

When I had a small question about this bottle‚Äôs charging, I reached out to the seller, and they got back to me within hours. They even sent me a quick video that explained everything I needed. That kind of responsiveness is rare these days, and it made me feel good about the purchase.

The bottle itself has been great so far‚Äîconsistent hydrogen levels, and the battery lasts longer than I expected. My only nitpick? I wish it came in more colors. But honestly, that‚Äôs me being picky. Overall, super happy with it, and it‚Äôs refreshing to deal with a brand that actually cares about its customers."*
  - 2024-12-01 | Example: Product Hydrogen water bottle (side note: this market is very competitive and requires high capital; I would not recommend it for beginners with a low budget)

A. Here's a basic Review:
"Customer service was amazing for this product. There was a QR code inside that you can scan if you need assistance and I had a question about washing the bottle. I scanned it and got a response in 3 minutes. The agent was extremely friendly and helpful. My question was answered immediately"

B. Here are 3 written ChatGPT reviews 

--Improved Review 1: Reliable Performance That Lives Up to the Hype
*"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a good hydrogen water bottle for a while now. I had tried [competitor‚Äôs product] before, and let‚Äôs just say it didn‚Äôt quite live up to its claims‚Äîthe hydrogen levels weren‚Äôt anywhere near what they advertised, and I ended up feeling like I wasted my money.

When I came across this bottle, I was a bit skeptical, but it‚Äôs honestly been such a pleasant surprise. I tested the hydrogen levels, and they‚Äôre exactly what‚Äôs promised. That‚Äôs a huge relief because I rely on this for better energy and mental clarity after workouts.

One thing I‚Äôd say is I wish the setup instructions were a little more detailed, but the product itself is solid. It works well, and I‚Äôve already recommended it to a couple of friends who were as frustrated as I was with other brands."*

  - 2024-12-05 | Hi <@1059659092475531444> , no worries I'm in a better place than where i was at last week. i do agree with that cause my mental health just started to decline.  Will do and will take care when its time i will be ready. üòé
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi <@1059659092475531444>,

currently not doing well. in a lowest point in life. lots of emotional outbrust Process is going okay but decide to take some time off first so currently on pause. will be back soon should be in a couple of days because i feel alot better than where i was at in the past 1-2 weeks . 

progress is going at a good pace for the past 3-4 months and was going a rate that I think was okay and didn't felt too rush. im sure there was will be challenges i will be facing soon but 

will be back and ready to take it on
  - 2024-11-26 | Got it, will take that into factor with the freight forwarder
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi Jamie, thanks for the advice and head up about comparing shipping cost. Will go ahead and do that
  - 2024-11-26 | overall you guys had experience this the past what would be the better chocie ?
  - 2024-11-26 | When having the product ship from the supplier facotry. It is better to have the supplier ship it or should the inspector who offer the service do it ?
  - 2024-11-17 | but yeah I will work my supplier on that part to get the battery exemption sheet
  - 2024-11-17 | I think the issue was that I had put another market place instead of the us so i went ahead and make new a listing for it so now I am able to print the item label
  - 2024-11-17 | on the good news I got the item label
  - 2024-11-17 | yeah air duster
ohhhh okay Ill go ahead and ask my supplier for that as well
  - 2024-11-16 | <@536075832658231299>  I didnt do the battery exemption sheet cause the product does have battery in it. 

CC: <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444>
  - 2024-11-16 | wait another day to see if anything changes ?
  - 2024-11-16 | Should I create a new listing ?
  - 2024-11-16 | 
  - 2024-11-16 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444> 

still having the same issue from yesterday
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> let me try it again tonight. Currently stuck at the work office
  - 2024-11-15 | yeah was trying to trouble shoot this but stuck at the moment
  - 2024-11-15 | but I got confused when speaking with them on the phone
  - 2024-11-15 | the item label to apply on the box
  - 2024-11-15 | Cause I thought you just need to hit print label item and it should be good to go ?
  - 2024-11-15 | unless it should be a quick print ?
  - 2024-11-15 | contact seller suppor team and these are steps they told me before printing out the label (barcode)
  - 2024-11-15 | watching the the tutorial minh sent over too. trying to retrace my steps and seeing where I went wrong but cant seem troubleshoot correctly to find the root cause
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | <@1059659092475531444> clicked "print item label" from FBA listing and this pop up
  - 2024-11-15 | <@1059659092475531444> this is what i have at the moment
  - 2024-11-15 | just got this email
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | its on FBA
  - 2024-11-15 | So i did that  and having the same issue
  - 2024-11-15 | i think it has to be realting to the label
  - 2024-11-15 | my supplier asked me just now
  - 2024-11-15 | what does it mean by shipping is mark ?
  - 2024-11-15 | okay let me try that
  - 2024-11-15 | is there a way to change it or do i need to create another listing ?
  - 2024-11-15 | cause I believe i had create this one and select FMB
  - 2024-11-15 | so making a listing for fba ?
  - 2024-11-15 | ohhhh okay
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | just trying to see if i have miss anything
  - 2024-11-15 | it should be there but each time I press it it said item not submiteed
  - 2024-11-15 | Im trying to print the label item so I can sent it to my supplier
  - 2024-11-15 | Hello guys
  - 2024-10-20 | got it thanks for clearing it up on that for now i will select one just get things going
  - 2024-10-20 | How would I go about this ?
  - 2024-10-20 | When trying to pick a warehouse loation, there is not one in the state where my LLC regiestered. in this case should I go ahead and pick one in CA ??
  - 2024-10-18 | I will probably use a warehouse in the state my LLC is registered so that it make okay for now
  - 2024-10-18 | for the meantime
  - 2024-10-18 | thanks for head up but will see where this lead to
  - 2024-10-18 | oh nooooo
  - 2024-10-18 | when you said there no issue on shipping
  - 2024-10-18 | but I rather take that route to be honest
  - 2024-10-18 | but after this make more sense
  - 2024-10-18 | yeah cause I was gonna use a warehouse location in wyoming for now
  - 2024-10-18 | okay that alot more sense now
  - 2024-10-18 | ohhhhh okay
  - 2024-10-18 | not sure if that was the right reponse but it was a try
  - 2024-10-18 | i think for their shipping quote is through sea freight with DDP (postal service)
  - 2024-10-18 | its for the tax exempt part
  - 2024-10-18 | until everything is finalize then it will be change
  - 2024-10-18 | cause I was gonna give my supplier one of the warehouse from the state that my LLC is registered in for now
  - 2024-10-18 | from their side ?
  - 2024-10-18 | not sure which warehouse
  - 2024-10-18 | shipping is $423
  - 2024-10-18 | yes that is what I meant
  - 2024-10-18 | Good morning Minh 

Ohhhhh okay that make more sense thanks for clearing it up

For the estimate shipping cost that even applied if the supplier give you the shipping cost with the MOQ as well ?

  - 2024-12-12 | <@1066465177140215928> can I get the link for an appointment?
  - 2024-12-11 | 1) What are the things that we did well?- 

-During the beginning of my journey, I went from doing 50/50 reviews to 100% reviews from friends and family. 

-I also enlisted in Vine reviews and have gotten positive feedback from it.  

2)What could we have done better?

- I could have paid more attention to PPC on catching bleeders, but since I was trying to gather reviews, I was being aggressive with PPC and letting it ride to gain more sales. 

-I‚Äôm more cautious of PPC now. 
 
Where were the biggest challenges?- 

-After I resubmitted PPC Excel sheet to Han's PPC tool, I became more attentive toward PPC and watched for bleeders. I think I grasped the PPC ideology down. 

3)What have I been avoiding that needs attention? 

-I‚Äôve been so busy at work with my clients since it‚Äôs the holiday season, it‚Äôs been busy. I‚Äôm exhausted when I get home. Plus, not trying to give an excuse, I‚Äôm tired. I need to be more active in the community. Choe and Louis are the people I check in with at least 2 times a week. 

4) Am I closer to achieving my goals? Yes or No? 

-I don‚Äôt know about closer, but I‚Äôm moving towards that direction. 


What do you want to happen at the end of Q4?

- I want to break even in order to place the second batch order.


5) What do I want to happen at the end of the month? 

-I want to see positive numbers, instead of negative numbers.
  - 2024-12-10 | Got my first Vine review at 5*
  - 2024-12-10 | <@536075832658231299>  <@1066465177140215928> um, if I were to start a new campaign with broad, phrase, and exact, do I need to do another ultimate and auto? Or when I launch the new campaign, just turn off certain key words and lower the budget to allocate to newer campaigns?
  - 2024-12-10 | What are the things that we did well?- Um, I went from doing 50/50 review, to 100% review. 
What could we have done better?- Pay more attention to PPC, but my thought were let it ride and gain more sales. 
Where were the biggest challenges?- after re submitting PPC Excel sheet to Han's PPC tool, now gonna optimize around  Breakeven Acos or under. 
What have I been avoiding that needs attention? Watching the Mods
Am I closer to achieving my goals? Yes or No? No, but staying positive and inching forward
What do you want to happen at the end of Q4?- Breakeven in order to place batch 2
What do I want to happen at the end of the month? More sales and breakeven
  - 2024-12-09 | I also lowered the budget per campaign wondering if that was a smart move!!? I can raise it back again.   I guess my concerns are not trying to get negative again, looking to breakeven forthe next batch, and also, should I optimize once a week, or every 2 days?
  - 2024-12-09 | @Han I submitted into PPC assistance, please disregard this first submission. The second submissions is the correct one with the price of 44.99
  - 2024-12-09 | I also raised my price 4 dollars
  - 2024-12-09 | 
  - 2024-12-09 | I‚Äôve been letting it go in order to gain sales!
  - 2024-12-09 | Should I be optimizing every 2 days in order to control bleeders?
  - 2024-12-01 | <@1066465177140215928>! For ur journey, how long before u saw profit? I remember you said you spent about $50k plus before u you saw profit?
  - 2024-11-20 | Since the beginning of my journey, I‚Äôve been doing 50/50 custom FBM review. Should I switch to 100% review?
  - 2024-11-20 | I have a meeting with <@1066465177140215928> next week, so hopefully it will pick up.
  - 2024-11-20 | I understand, but PPC is bleeding.  I understand the focus on the first batch is to gain ranking and gather as much review as possibly, but my board camp is hitting hard. What should I do? I lowered it according to the cheatsheet <@536075832658231299> give me.
  - 2024-11-19 | <@1066465177140215928> since my market is constantly changing, should I adjust my price of my product to stay below break even or a little above break even Acos?  Also optimizing to stay below break even Acos?
  - 2024-11-13 | <@1054411267340763216> can you help me with my FBM purchase and review!? Please and Thank you!
  - 2024-11-06 | How much would you charge for a redo of 1 main image?
  - 2024-11-06 | <@1066465177140215928>

  - 2024-10-29 | Let‚Äôs do this!
  - 2024-10-29 | I‚Äôll ask
  - 2024-10-29 | I‚Äôm considering dropping my price to generate more sales and optimizing
  - 2024-10-29 | Han! I'm still gathering review until now, but is there anything else I can do to improve sales?
  - 2024-10-29 | done and submitted!
  - 2024-10-28 | Okay! Should I use the data to generate other keywords?
  - 2024-10-23 | Hi Han! I reentered the update information onto my PPC tracker. Can you take a quick look at it together with the information I submitted in the PPC assistance tool to see if they look correct.
  - 2024-10-23 | 
  - 2024-10-22 | I‚Äôm on if you wanna join a lil early
  - 2024-10-21 | <@536075832658231299>  just to confirm our meeting tomorrow at 4?

  - 2024-10-21 | I accidentally did it
  - 2024-10-17 | I don‚Äôt want to miss any opportunity?
  - 2024-10-17 | Since yesterday was the 14 mark, should I work with some of for the program to optimize the campaign according to Q4 bids?
  - 2024-10-15 | Do you have anything sooner?  Tomorrow is the 14 days mark, and the appointment I made is next week
  - 2024-10-15 | Han! I accidentally made  two appointments with you for next week. Just keep the one on Tuesday at 4.
  - 2024-10-15 | I assumed once I copy and paste the link, it would work automatically
  - 2024-10-15 | I got it!
  - 2024-10-15 | Ok!
  - 2024-10-15 | I was trying to look for it
  - 2024-10-15 | Susan! I remember you shared this file with Ngoc and me
  - 2024-10-15 | I have a meeting with Susan later today, I‚Äôll bring up all the questions I have with her. After, I‚Äôll schedule an appointment with you, Han, to go over optimization.
  - 2024-10-15 | I copied the link to the search engine, but it‚Äôs not letting me edit the ppc tracker page.

  - 2024-12-05 | <@1230862203146473472> can you share with the group how you were able to get access to premium a+ within 1-2 days after contacting amazon support? what did you do, which outlets did you contact and how quickly were you able to resolve it?
  - 2024-12-04 | what is it asking for
  - 2024-11-22 | Han might have some useful tips. In the past, I tried tracking the times of day when orders were placed‚Äîearly morning, mid-day, or evening‚Äîto see if there was a specific trend. The idea was to allocate more budget during peak times using Amazon PPC‚Äôs time scheduling feature. However, my product didn‚Äôt show a consistent trend, so I ended up not utilizing the time scheduling tool.
  - 2024-10-23 | that's fine. raise your price too <@1167106129415909496>
  - 2024-10-08 | i personally look at each campaign individually. if they are performing (i.e. making sales and meeting target acos or lower, i will increase. if it's just a bit above target acos, i would still increase). if they haven't performed at all, i will not increase.
  - 2024-10-11 | <@809813064756887582> post your info here so han can get you added to private channel
  - 2024-12-13 | Do you have Macy‚Äôs PayPal?
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi friendly reminder to use the private channels that way any of the shifus can help if Han is busy!
  - 2024-12-10 | Yes you can turn off. Is this your old or new product?
  - 2024-12-10 | are you running some sort of A/B testing? this happened to me before and turns out the reason was because amazon automatically opted me into a/b testing. what happens here is the old and new titles are shown at random.
  - 2024-12-05 | have them send it to you directly and you can replace it. we want to minimize returns to amazon.
  - 2024-12-03 | Olesia had this idea before.

<@536075832658231299> do you want to share your opinion on it? we talked about this recently.
  - 2024-11-21 | We make our own as every product is unique. Main thing you‚Äôll want to check is that all the features work as you advertise it, quality or printing/logo, specs (weight/measurements) if important, all components are in the box, and insert/card manual <@505081578247159830>
  - 2024-11-20 | it should automatically override with the bigger discount (which is the BF)
  - 2024-11-19 | yes they can but usually not significant
  - 2024-11-19 | not sure why this happens - it happens to me too. i'll usually go into edit and republish my manychat and that seems to fix it - though not permanently.
  - 2024-11-18 | <@1230862203146473472> can you let <@750566740424917045> know who/what number/email you contacted to help you get premium a+ access?

  - 2024-10-17 | <@809813064756887582>
  - 2024-08-09 | This is correct!
  - 2024-08-08 | See ^ - higher means harder and more competitive to rank on. It's good if you are meeting those numbers, but as a new seller we need to balance using a good mix of higher and lower cpr words with a decent search volume.
  - 2024-08-08 | 
  - 2024-10-29 | Seems like I need to do this homework too üòÇ
  - 2024-12-11 | Never know when it will be available or go into fc transfer again
  - 2024-12-11 | I wouldn‚Äôt even worry about just 1 piece left. Just close
  - 2024-12-02 | yes this is right
  - 2024-11-10 | Who left the review?
  - 2024-11-03 | 20% off your current selling price
  - 2024-11-03 | i believe it has to be 20% minimum discount from the lowest price you've been selling at. han correct me if i'm wrong.
  - 2024-11-03 | i usually just do the % off and then set minimum price but there's no wrong way
  - 2024-12-06 | Love how resourceful you are!
  - 2024-12-06 | it got pushed down to the bottom of the listing w/ shoppable videos
  - 2024-12-06 | <@536075832658231299> do you know if amz changed this process? i haven't uploaded a video in the last 2 months. when we uploaded olesia's it didn't show up next to her listing images.
  - 2024-12-05 | <@1230862203146473472> add coupon to your listing
  - 2024-11-17 | olesia i will do this for you today.

but if you go to inventory, manage all inventory, click edit on the FBA listing, all the copy will be on the product details tab
  - 2024-10-20 | there's really no way of knowing so don't stress too hard on this
  - 2024-10-20 | you can pick any to get a quote. just keep in mind that if you pick one in CA, shipping may end up being higher if that's the the one your goods get sent to
  - 2024-10-18 | this happened to me on my first bulk order
  - 2024-10-18 | sucks to be quoted 400 for WC then when you actually do shipping, you have to ship to a bunch of EC warehouses and the rate is 1000
  - 2024-10-18 | oh that will probably be expensive but you won't have any surprises when you actually ship haha
  - 2024-10-18 | my guess is most will try using a west coast warehouse to show the cheapest rate
  - 2024-10-18 | yeah so it could be worth asking or maybe you can say, can you quote me to ship to X warehouse at amazon
  - 2024-10-18 | this is the "Warehouse ID"
  - 2024-10-18 | yes but to get quote they would have to know "we are shipping from china to amz warehouse MDW2" or something like that
  - 2024-10-18 | i'm wondering what destination they used to get their shipping quote... because WC rates will be much less than EC or midwest. but yes def ask about one near you.

if needed you can check with a few shipping agents to compare too.
  - 2024-10-18 | do you know which warehouse was used as point of reference?
  - 2024-10-18 | as far as the shipping cost/unit itself?
  - 2024-10-18 | do you know what the break down is?
  - 2024-10-18 | you mean your supplier already gave you a shipping estimate, which was included in your total bulk order?
  - 2024-11-18 | omg an, CONGRATS. my husband and i shot vietnamese american weddings for the longest time. got me feeling all nostalgic over here lol! can't imagine how exhausted you might be haha
  - 2024-10-10 | I usually go off cpc if I need to aggressively bring acos down, otherwise I go off the current bid

Your bid is the max you‚Äôre willing to pay
  - 2024-10-14 | i would just close if 2 units. when is your next batch coming?
  - 2024-10-14 | thats fine
  - 2024-10-14 | just make sure you reopen before 30 days so the units don't get returned to you
  - 2024-10-14 | how long has it been? the 30 day rule han mentioned before still applies and amazon may automatically reopen your listing
  - 2024-10-14 | it could be returns, could be. units they lost and found. this happens often
  - 2024-12-12 | make sure you watch "PPC Training Keyword Research" in the PPC Module.  if you follow this video, you shouldn't have a problem finding keywords for your launch campaigns

  - 2024-11-24 | i had this issue recenlty
  - 2024-11-24 | go edit and republish your manychat
  - 2024-11-03 | han and minh both may have different approach too! but that's what i do
  - 2024-11-03 | there's no right or wrong way to do this as i believe it's preference. so you can do a bulk adjustment (decrease by %, then increase after it's over). i cherry picked the ones that were bleeding out during that timeframe
  - 2024-11-03 | i also drop my budget
  - 2024-11-03 | when i notice that their deal is cannibalizing my sales
  - 2024-11-03 | i do
  - 2024-10-28 | phuong i sent you a video on where/how to export like 2 weeks ago
  - 2024-10-28 | have you checked the market? last week, i noticed my sales were sooooo slow. when that happens i often look at my market to see what's happening. i found out my top competitor was running a limited time deal 7 days, priced 15 cheaper than my product. the sale ended last night and my sales seem to have returned to normal.
  - 2024-10-17 | but if they find the units later, they'll take the money back
  - 2024-10-17 | if it's their fault i believe they'll reimburse you
  - 2024-10-17 | yeah your invoice should be fine in this case. i think this is a new process. i have had so many discrepancies and they never asked me to upload anything. only  one time when they said they didn't have an entire shipment.
  - 2024-10-15 | In general if the quality is worthy of purchasing. Do you think it‚Äôs worth using as an ad later in the future? That kind of thing
  - 2024-10-15 | i found a way to do this but it's tricky and requires some trial and error. he might ask you to take it down if he catches it too... just a note

500 is not really bad, if he won't negotiate down, ask if you can decide after the video has been posted. that way you know if it's worth your time or not
  - 2024-10-15 | i wonder if you can just download the story once it's live lol let me test
  - 2024-10-15 | i think it's a good test, but try to see if you can get a copy of that video
  - 2024-10-15 | and is it a story series for just 1 story slide?
  - 2024-10-15 | see if he will share the story video with you after (like for you to keep for yourself)
  - 2024-10-15 | what %?
  - 2024-10-15 | did he send you proof of big US audience?
  - 2024-10-21 | this can happen anytime. the market moves fast. speed of execution is key.
  - 2024-10-17 | I skipped package design on my first batch. It‚Äôs a nice touch but not worth risking if you‚Äôre required To have 1000 units. I did custom package on second batch.
  - 2024-10-16 | too risky. agree with minh üëÜ need proof of concept first
  - 2024-12-12 | <@1168356026471436323> what chuong is talking about han has covered and taught before. you have to do the daily visibility spreadsheet to find out cost of acquisition
  - 2024-11-02 | i always recommend having a list or idea of what you need. for example: 

- 2 product shots on white background
- 5 lifestyle photos with product (briefly describe setting/mood/vibe and whether it should or should not have people)

if you're not good at describing, create a pinterest moodboard to share w/ photographer.

you cannot rely on someone especially graphic designer or photographer to communicate your brand.

if you're not sure how much you need, it might be better to plan the website first and ask for photo assets later. Or - if you don't know but want the photos first, you can just ask for flat 10-15 pics that you can repurpose and use for anything else.

  - 2024-10-29 | are you sea shipping? sometimes they cannot provide a tracking #
  - 2024-10-16 | inspection is similar price for everyone. shipping is where rates can vary - and reasonable is subjective as everyone's product size, type, etc varies. things to consider if it's reasonable for you:

1. does it significantly impact your overall margin? 
2. have you gotten 2-3 other quotes to compare so you stretch every penny you can?
3. how long will it take? 
4. do you need to get it here faster? if so, do you need to consider partial air and sea shipping.

Thank you for sending over the video this morning. We truly appreciate your patience and understanding throughout the process, especially given the initial delay caused by the software update. While we had communicated our decision to part ways due to the extended timeline, we‚Äôd be happy to move forward with the first posting of the video and will no longer request the payment. We‚Äôre grateful for your effort and contribution, and we‚Äôd love to conclude our sponsorship on a positive note. Thank you again
  - 2024-10-11 | i'm thinking the same. he has 31k subscribers on youtube. i suggested taking the shitty video and not moving forward with second video
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont want him to make a video NOT recommending it or talking about how much it sucks
  - 2024-12-10 | no need to redo ultimate and auto.

you can either do new campaigns with new budget or turn off keywords and add new ones. if you're just testing new keywords, i would personally do new campaign but either way works here.

"So after barebone listing, should i create a contract with supplier and schedule a call with the instructors so i can place the bulk order?"

  - 2024-10-14 | make sure you sell some FBM at the 30% higher price
  - 2024-10-14 | ignore sale price bc you're not running a sale.

  - 2024-10-30 | no you shouldn't have to
  - 2024-10-15 | Amazon can hold payment for over 14 days, as an ‚Äúaccount level reserve.‚Äù This is something you agreed to, when you signed up.

The reserve amount is determined by various things. These include how long you‚Äôve had your account, returns, reviews, and if you have any unresolved disputes.

if everything is good, you will eventually be paid out for everything just takes some time at first
  - 2024-10-15 | <@1213335800205414452> sorry for the delay. reposting your ? here in case han can provide better explanation too

" I was not sure about Account Level Reserved. Why amz keep much on these?"
  - 2024-10-21 | justin/chuong plus minh and i are also in here but no one else from the program.
  - 2024-12-06 | amazon probably has it's own logic of applying what they think is most relevant and sorts it that way but we are looking for the low hanging fruits, which may not be those top performing/relevant keywords.
  - 2024-12-05 | <@1212209797345185883> following up from class. the top performing keywords for me were not all from top suggested keywords list. only one of them was.
  - 2024-12-01 | but i haven't tracked it closely and consistently so han could be right
  - 2024-12-01 | from my own experience, i don't think it's included in the units sold but it gets deducted from inventory
  - 2024-10-23 | I usually just take a verbal agreement in email or whatever communication channel
  - 2024-10-17 | you mean NOT the friends and family thing. so it will be a business transaction
  - 2024-10-17 | their preferred method. for all of mine, it has been paypal

what's standard - also paypal
  - 2024-10-17 | i also pay every influencer after they make the video
  - 2024-10-17 | someone recently paid a deposit and the influencer did not deliver

  - 2024-12-11 | I‚Äôve gotten 2 customer reviews so far and managed to get 1 FBM purchase with someone help. Still need 4 more FBM orders to hit my goal for the week. I made 2 promo videos for IG, YouTube, and FB but still need to create and post one more to hit my 3-post goal for the week.

I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on ad spend and tweaking a few keywords here and there. Sales have been pretty decent over the past week, around 4‚Äì5 a day. Ad spend has gone up quite a bit, but I think the overall ACOS is still in a good range.

Today marks exactly two months since I launched my product. I still vividly remember Susan mentioning in one of her posts that selling on Amazon is like riding a roller coaster of emotions. It‚Äôs not for the faint of heart, and now, after two months, I truly understand what she meant.
It‚Äôs been challenging to figure out whether what I‚Äôm focusing on is working or not. Sales have been slow, PPC spending has skyrocketed, and during the first four weeks, I faced 10 returns. At times, it felt impossible to see anything positive in this situation.
Thankfully, I had a Zoom call with Shifu Justin, who encouraged me to see the bigger picture and not get caught up in the day-to-day fluctuations. He reminded me to be patient, take the hits, and always think long-term. We never know when a product will take off, and the key is to aim for at least 30% organic sales.
Looking back on my journey so far, I started with 43% organic sales in the first month and managed to increase that to 46% in the second month. Overall, my sales have grown since launch, even though my profit is slightly in the red. But that‚Äôs just part of "taking the punch."
Now, I‚Äôm learning to approach this progress with a clearer perspective and less stress. Success isn‚Äôt measured day by day. It‚Äôs measured over months and years. I‚Äôm adjusting to the ups and downs of this roller coaster ride. It‚Äôs both exciting and challenging, but this is exactly what I signed up for.

  - 2024-12-11 | Hey Tara, if you go to Manage Inventory and click on the reserved quantity, you‚Äôll be able to see the details about why those units are in reserve.
  - 2024-12-04 | Thanks Jamie! I was thinking to ask the customer to send me image or video of the product to show me the issue so that I can better assist.
  - 2024-12-04 | Can they send images or video through Amazon ?
  - 2024-12-04 | I received a message from a customer in Seller Central. Is it okay to ask them to message me on Messenger for better assistance, or would that violate Amazon's regulations?
  - 2024-12-11 | 4. To truly connect with others, you need to know and love yourself first. When you understand your own feelings, needs, and experiences, it makes it easier to be compassionate towards others. Self-awareness helps you set boundaries, communicate better, and take care of your own well-being. Loving yourself isn‚Äôt just for self-care. It‚Äôs about being able to show that same love and understanding to the people around you.
  - 2024-12-11 | 3.  You‚Äôre only getting older, and a year from now, you‚Äôll be the same person you are today, just with more fine lines and gray hair. The difference between where you are now and where you could be is the effort you put in today. Small, consistent actions add up over time and lead to big changes. Don‚Äôt waste another year. Take action now and make it count!
  - 2024-12-11 | 1. Don‚Äôt fear failure: It‚Äôs better to fail at something you care about than not try at all. Every success has failure behind it. Learn from it, grow, and keep going. Failure is just part of the process. Take the leap and you‚Äôll be glad you did!

2, Invest in yourself early: Whether it's learning new skills or taking care of your health and your appearances, start early. It pays off in the long run and your future self will thank you.

  - 2024-12-02 | Robert Kiyosaki's shift in mindset came from Dr. R  rejection and  his question: "What does God want done?" instead of focusing solely on personal wealth. He realized that the purpose behind his creation Rich Dad Poor Dad was to serve others through financial education. The video remind us that business success comes not from taking, but from meeting customers' needs and creating meaningful value. Entrepreneurs should aim to serve their audience first, and in doing so, they achieve their own success.

  - 2024-12-09 | Today‚Äôs Monday Mindset session with Shifu Charlie focused on envisioning who we want to become in 2025. It was about setting clear goals, taking action, writing them down, and prioritizing what truly matters: eliminating distractions and keeping only the most important things and people in your life.

  - 2024-12-03 | Last month I created the attribution link to test it and sent it to the person who helps me with FBM purchases and reviews. After she completed the purchase, I was able to see the traffic data and received a 10% refund on the referral fees. While my intention was just to test the link, I‚Äôve come to realize that using it for FBM purchases and reviews can help recoup some of the referral fees paid to Amazon. Has anyone else tried this? Are there any risks involved? ü§î

  - 2024-11-30 | Hi Hannah! If your bulk order is ready to ship, you‚Äôll need to create shipping labels to send to the supplier. The shipping labels will include the addresses of the warehouses where the cartons will be delivered.
  - 2024-11-30 | That‚Äôs what I thought too! I didn‚Äôt get to choose the warehouses for my bulk order either. I‚Äôm not sure how we can select specific warehouses to save money.
  - 2024-11-30 | The shipping quote might not be exact, but it should be fairly close to what you'll actually pay once your bulk order is ready to ship.
  - 2024-11-30 | Hey Hannah, you can randomly select any warehouse address to provide to the shipping agent for the shipping quote. If shipping to the West Coast turns out to be the most affordable option, then choose addresses from that region. You won‚Äôt know the specific addresses until you‚Äôre ready to create shipping labels for your supplier.
  - 2024-11-29 | Yes! Usually, if they don‚Äôt want you to use their video on other platforms, they‚Äôll only send a preview version with the word ‚ÄúPREVIEW‚Äù over it to prevent you from using it.
  - 2024-11-29 | If the influencer allows you to download the video freely or doesn‚Äôt mention any copyright restrictions, you can use the video across any platform.
  - 2024-11-29 | Yes you can! I just did that a few days ago.
  - 2024-11-21 | I didn't pay tax.

  - 2024-12-02 | Got it! Thanks
  - 2024-12-02 | This might be a silly question, but in the video, Susan mentioned picking the longest date range you‚Äôve been selling. Does that mean it‚Äôs not from when I last optimized until now? <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-24 | Thanks Han! That's what I'm trying to figure out is how I can determine the next bid according to the recorded data. Is it too new to see the pattern?
  - 2024-10-24 | Is the rule for setting a new bid for ASIN targets different from that for keywords? I've noticed that ASINs with no clicks have had their bids increased by 7 to 10%. If I need to set the new bid manually, how can I determine the appropriate percentage to increase it by?
  - 2024-10-24 | Could you please explain why the PPC assistant set the new bid 8% higher than the CPC for this ASIN target? <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-17 | I'm a bit confused about what the new bids should be for these two keywords. üòµ‚Äçüí´ <@536075832658231299>

  - 2024-11-25 | I think I finally figured out how to update the link‚Äîit‚Äôs been a while since I last did that. I copied the link from the new flow, pasted it into the Tiger QR code I‚Äôm using for the insert card, and then turned off the trigger for the old chat flow. Am I doing this correctly?
  - 2024-11-25 | Do I turn off the trigger for the old flow?
  - 2024-11-25 | done
  - 2024-11-25 | I‚Äôve already reached out to ManyChat customer support for help. I‚Äôm unsure what else I can do to resolve the issue.
  - 2024-11-25 | Just happened again
  - 2024-11-25 | how do I change the link to the qrcode?
  - 2024-11-24 | Yes
  - 2024-11-24 | This happened almost everytime someone scan the qr code.
  - 2024-11-24 | I did that and then click on live
  - 2024-11-24 | I don't see republish button
  - 2024-11-24 | how do I republish? Do I click on live?
  - 2024-11-24 | 
  - 2024-11-24 | 
  - 2024-11-24 | Hi <@536075832658231299>,

I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is, but it seems that customers who scan the QR code aren‚Äôt being prompted by ManyChat. The chat flow doesn‚Äôt appear. Could the QR code be the problem? What should I do? ü´§
  - 2024-11-23 | Airtable doesn‚Äôt have a field to enter return costs.
  - 2024-11-23 | thanks

  - 2024-11-22 | The Airtable form doesn‚Äôt let me enter a negative gross profit, which I‚Äôve had most weeks. So, I‚Äôm sending you the spreadsheet instead. üòÖ <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-21 | Hi <@536075832658231299> ! I‚Äôm unsure where to categorize these costs: promo costs and coupon fees. Also, for replacement orders, do those count as units sold without any sales or additional fees? Additionally, I‚Äôve noticed that some of my referral fees are significantly higher than others, and some orders don‚Äôt have any referral fees at all, even though the sold price is the same. What could be causing this?
  - 2024-11-17 | I still need sometime to work on it.  I will submit it tomorrow.  Thanks for  reminding me, Jamie!
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you Jamie
  - 2024-11-11 | Okay! I'll try that
  - 2024-11-11 | 
  - 2024-11-11 | I tested it again last night and encountered the same issue. I had to upload it twice for ManyChat to acknowledge it.
  - 2024-11-11 | Hi Han! She did click on the button.
  - 2024-11-11 | I'm not sure why this issue keeps occurring with my ManyChat flow. After a customer uploads her screenshot, ManyChat still displays a message saying it hasn't been received. I‚Äôve tested the flow several times, and it seemed to work fine, but this has now happened twice when customers have uploaded their screenshots. Each time, I had to step in, apologize, and confirm that they would receive the gift card by email.
  - 2024-11-03 | thanks
  - 2024-11-03 | okay
  - 2024-11-03 | and then adjust it again when th limited time deal is over?
  - 2024-11-03 | Do I just do a bulk adjustment to all the keywords ?
  - 2024-11-03 | Should I adjust my PPC campaign when a competitor is running a Limited Time Deal? My PPC spend is higher than usual, but I‚Äôm not seeing any sales.
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you, Susan! Yes, I check the market every day to see if a price adjustment is needed. My pricing is slightly better than competitors‚Äô, though I‚Äôve noticed many new sellers undercutting with lower prices. I also spoke with other mentees in the same niche, and it seems we‚Äôre all facing the same issues‚Äîhigh PPC costs and slow sales.
  - 2024-10-28 | I forgot to click on target before exporting. sorry! üòÖ
  - 2024-10-28 | I just resubmit for ppc assistant.
  - 2024-10-28 | I just submitted a request for a PPC assistant. Over the last five days, my PPC spend was only $285‚Äîbelow my ACOS‚Äîbut sales have been slow from day one. I‚Äôm not sure if this is just a niche-wide slowdown or is it just my listing is not attracting buyers .

Right now, I‚Äôm working on driving more sales outside of Amazon through influencer marketing and to add additional video content for both my listing and social media. Is there anything else you‚Äôd recommend to help boost sales?

Thanks so much for your advice!
  - 2024-10-17 | I saw this in campaign manager for growth opportunity suggesting I could drive an estimated $2,115 in sales for my product due to increased organic clicks.  Would you recommend participating in something like this? <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-17 | Thanks, Susan

  - 2024-10-17 | 
  - 2024-10-15 | got it! Thanks <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-10-15 | Thanks for checking! That‚Äôs odd, it‚Äôs still not working on my end. I‚Äôll try testing it again or maybe use another device. Thanks Han!

  - 2024-10-15 | Do you mean I should wait to see if the story is effective in increasing sales, and then, if it is, ask for the video and pay the rest?
  - 2024-10-15 | He's very active on his page which is a good thing. And he reply quickly.

  - 2024-12-13 | The attribution link allows you to track traffic and sales generated from the influencer‚Äôs channel. Whenever someone makes a purchase, Amazon rewards you with 10% of the product price. This amount will be applied to your FBA fees two months after the sale.
  - 2024-12-13 | This is where you create attribution links for your social media influencers. You can generate multiple links for different influencers. <@1201916452471578644>

  - 2024-11-04 | Since I am still in the product research phase, that's my one and only focus now. If you want, I can send a daily update late at night giving you updates on what I've done that day.

My strategy so far has been using TikTok for product ideas then hopping on AMZ and using Helium to see if it's a viable product and updating my product tracking sheet. Let me know  if you see a way to improve things.
  - 2024-11-03 | Hi brother! As you know, I am still in the product research phase. The last few weeks have been challenging but I am praying and staying positive. During the last few weeks I have finalized my divorce and my priority has been my 5 year old son Alex. I have finally found an apartment and some stability for him and me. The divorce has not been easy on my son and he has had a lot of behavioral issues which we are seeing a counselor for.  Right now is the most stability I have had in over 1 year. I know I haven't been able to stay consistent in this program. Raniel is my accountability partner and Olesia has been a HUGE help. All this is to say that I have struggled. I'm not looking for sympathy, ultimately, I need to be more accountable and  I have no one to blame but myself.  Life is not easy and everyone has some form of issues related to health/life/children. It is a part of life. Having said all of this, I promise you I will hold myself to higher standards and be more accountable and submit homework on a regular basis going forward. Please write me up next time I don't submit a homework.
  - 2024-10-21 | <@1266755529984835626>  and I are partnering up as accountability partners.

  - 2024-12-05 | Hi sis
Once your brand is approved, you typically don't need to do anything extra to ensure the product is listed under your brand. Double-check the "Brand" field when adding the new listing, and that should ensure it's associated with your brand.

  - 2024-11-26 | The freight forwarder often has more favorable shipping rates because they are experienced in logistics and long-term contracts with carriers
  - 2024-11-26 | From my experience, I suggest you compare the shipping costs between your supplier and the freight forwarder.
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi David
  - 2024-11-15 | This is the shipping label brother, sorry I am confused. Are you talking about the shipping label (apply on the carton for shipping to Amazon warehouse) or the item label (apply on the box)?
  - 2024-11-15 | you can click on "print item label" from FBA listing
  - 2024-11-15 | can you capture the manage listings please?
  - 2024-11-15 | I think  maybe they are asking about the shipping label
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | You can do both FBM and FBA on the same ASIN
On your FBM listing, select "Add another condition" and set it up as FBA. This will create a new FBA listing for the same ASIN with a new SKU
  - 2024-11-15 | I think you printed the item label from FBM listing
  - 2024-11-15 | May I ask do you create FBA listing?

  - 2024-12-13 | you can choose the downgrade to the individual selling plan now until you start to bulk order and upgrade to the professional plan
  - 2024-12-13 | Yes please choose downgrade
  - 2024-12-12 | You haven't started selling on Amazon yet, so change to an individual selling plan and you won't bear a subscription fee per month
  - 2024-12-12 | Hi <@1302992418341261386> 
For Amazon sellers, a monthly subscription fee typically refers to the cost of using Amazon's selling platform. There are two main types of selling accounts, each with its associated subscription fee:

1. Individual Selling Plan:
No monthly fee: You don't pay a monthly subscription fee, but you will incur a $0.99 fee per item sold (in addition to other selling fees like referral fees and shipping costs).
This plan is best for sellers who expect to sell fewer than 40 items per month.

2. Professional Selling Plan:
$39.99 per month 
This plan allows you to sell more than 40 items per month, and it comes with additional features like access to Amazon‚Äôs advertising tools, bulk listing, and advanced reporting.

  - 2024-12-04 | Welcome <@746902307181953043> üéâüéâüöÄ
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi everyone! excited to meet you all!!  I am Charmine Di Turi. I am currently 28 years old and just moved to the US 5 months ago. I am working in the hospitality industry. I am starting my Amazon Shifu mentorship journey today, November 9th, and I will succeed in this. Succeeding in this program means that I am able to make money passively, not live paycheck to paycheck, make myself proud, but most importantly pay it forward. I am excited to be a part of this community as I've seen the impact this program has given a lot of people- not just financially but their overall mindset in life. 1% greater everyday. I am so motivated to succeed because I believe I am in a place to help others and change lives. May not be many but I definitely want to create a greater impact. I am doing this for myself, my future children, my husband, those in need. I want to show them that hard-work pays off and life is meant to be enjoyed. We should be our own bosses and live our lives in our own terms. I want to be able to start a family and to travel. I do not want to be where I'm at- working 12-14 hour days and having only a day a week to spend with my husband. I want to be in control of my time. In the future, when I‚Äôm successful- I want to tell myself that Hard-work pays off and anything is possible. When encountering difficulty I will remind myself that:  Struggling is normal. If I give up now- I will be in the same situation for the rest of my life.  https://youtu.be/kwX118LM8vE

  - 2024-02-24 | I guess when the demand increase, they will increase their price too. Or maybe because we use them to open the LLC, so they can have a different price for us?! But im sure they know how to make money.
  - 2024-02-15 | I just let legalzoom did that for me. 49$

  - 2024-12-05 | thanks Chloe üôÇ Ok, so I guess that is necessary? That we need to order and pay for a external product ID no matter what kind of product it is?
  - 2024-12-04 | Finally got my Amazon seller account for America approved! üôÇ  So I started with a dummy listing since Ive been waiting to do that. But, I dont understand where to find the "External Product ID" and the "External Product ID Type". Attached a printscreen to be more specific.
  - 2024-11-25 | Hi! Maybe this is a stupid question... But, how do I know the cost of the shipping for my profit calculation? Since I dont know what FBA-destination Amazon will choose for me yet... I need to list my product before I get info about what FBA-adress my products be shipped  to, right?

  - 2024-12-09 | 
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Jamie! Im fine thanks, hope u are too... Still waiting for my first samples to arrive, excited about that. My biggest challenge right now is to get my supplier to apply all my requested changes on the product. Find the right packaging, and I find it hard to know exactly what to do and to do things in the right order. But ill get there...
  - 2024-11-15 | Do you think its ok even tho its in the baby-category?  if yes, ill start contacting suppliers and work on my profit-calculation. If you dont recommend to go with that product because of the "catagory" I have another ont that might be a potential product.
  - 2024-11-15 | The product that was "ok" is this one https://www.amazon.com/s?k=baby%20lounger%20nest%20portable&ref=glow_cls&refresh=1
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you <@1054411267340763216> for being so helpful and for all your patience
  - 2024-11-11 | Ok, thank you <@1054411267340763216>  ! That was my guess too, but I find the product super interesting since it‚Äôs the NO 1 baby product in Scandinavia. It‚Äôs a genius product. Too bad it‚Äôs not that big in the US yet. Thanks for your good advice as always üôèü´∂
  - 2024-11-11 | Here it is üôÇ
  - 2024-11-10 | H i again!Sorry for bothering with all these question... But the reason I dont want to ask this one officially is because its about a very spceial product that I would like to keep secret until I know how to deal with it. Hope its ok. 
In Sweden there is a product called "vibrating stroller rocket". Its universal for all baby strollers and puts the baby to sleep. Its a VERY popular product in Sweden. So I did some PR on Amazon and I noticed that this product isnt really big yet in the US. There is a couple of sellers making ok profit.  Is this a "dangerous" product to work with or how come the number of sellers are so few? Also a product I should stay away from? Or do you think I can go deeper with the anlysis? 

Heres the product https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHFDJ6P9?psc=1
  - 2024-11-09 | Ok, got it! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks Han! ‚≠êÔ∏èüôè
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi guys! Hope u are fine ‚ò∫Ô∏è just a quick question about my PR since I needed to cancel my product ‚Äúcordless table lamp rechargeable‚Äù. Is it just that kind of model that is on your black list? Or is it lightning over all? Would you recommend me to stay away from all kind of lamps?
  - 2024-10-28 | 
  - 2024-10-28 | Ah, I just saw that the class tomorrow is at 2 am in the morning for me. üòï  So I will not be able to attend. But I can attend the class at Friday if there is any?
  - 2024-10-28 | If i want to to bring a product up in the meeting for analyse, do I need to send any form to you before the class? üôÇ
  - 2024-10-26 | Perfect, thank you so much for that! What do I need to prepare for that class? üôÇ
  - 2024-10-26 | For me, the schedule looks like this with my timezone.
  - 2024-10-26 | So, Ive been trying to analyse around 15-20 products now. But since the class with you <@1054411267340763216> at wednesdays are at 3 am in the morning for me, I havent been able to join and bring them up for feedback in the class. Can i bring it up at another class? The one on thursdays, mondays or saturdays? These ones are more easy for me to attend because of the timezone... Or will that be the wrong forum for this?
  - 2024-10-21 | Thanks <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out... Really appreciate! Been feeling kind of lonely the past week. Its so hard to keep up with the classes since im in a different time zone. Even tho I watch the recordings I feel like Im behind since I dint get the same chance to participate live and ask questions... But I do my best! üôÇ 

Last week I leared how to use the PR-tracking sheet and I tried a lot of different tools in Helium10. Not sure how good my draft is but there is 7 products in my tracking sheet right now that Ive been practicing to analyze.  I try to find one product for each day. to analyze and find an opportunity with.
  - 2024-10-11 | I've been focused on taking care of all the formalities for the last two days as I couldn't sign up for an Amazon account without having a company specifically dedicated to this in Sweden. My accountant has helped me set this up, and it will take three business days after we applied for approval from the government yesterday. It's a bit of a longer startup process for me since I need to follow Swedish regulations, and it will cost me about 3,000 USD extra.  (good to know if there will be any other students from Sweden in the future) By Tuesday at the latest, all the paperwork should be done, and my company will be up and running, which means I can sign up for an Amazon Seller account then. In the meantime, I‚Äôve done as much product research as I can üôÇ Do you recommend me to attend class tomorrow anyway? Or should I keep doing the product research instead?
  - 2024-10-10 | Wonderful, thanks üôÇ
  - 2024-11-01 | Yes, we have matched up. Me and <@772970575144288288>  üôÇ
  - 2024-10-22 | Perfect! <@772970575144288288>
  - 2024-10-21 | My location is Sweden and my timezone is  GMT+2, my strengths is my energy and 
willingness to learn. Im a "protoganist" in the personality test üôÇ
  - 2024-12-09 | 1. That I could attend class today
2. my first samle arrived

  - 2024-12-12 | <@308107877493768193> FYI - I've added the terms and conditions to maintain the benefits for an Ambassador but couldn't edit the file you have shared, can you update your version and hold it as a copy since I already copied over what you got? That way it stays in sync...

  - 2024-12-12 | Good coaching call, tough love hope he gets back on track <@975774205658411068>

  - 2024-12-11 | Hi <@297667891992723457> , just to confirm, did Khoa reached out to you via DM correct? He's not currently in the community and basically looking to see what it'll cost to come back in?
  - 2024-12-11 | Thanks for raising this to our attention <@297667891992723457>
  - 2024-12-11 | Ok thanks, so it sounds like he needs more time, let me look into him tomorrow and I‚Äôll let you know next steps, I may have a call with him
  - 2024-12-11 | Can you share me his last name and I can look up his student profile
  - 2024-12-11 | Do you know when he went ‚Äúquiet‚Äù to give me an idea of the absence?
  - 2024-12-11 | Tim, can you give me some background info on him? I‚Äôll be handling membership related inquiries, what support does he need?
  - 2024-12-09 | <@1054411267340763216> See Louis message above, it's Jenny Dean
  - 2024-12-09 | <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444> Please assess to make sure Jenny is in position to launch before a call gets booked with Susan as we're not sure where she is at if we haven't been engaged with her directly before transitioning to pre-launch stage
  - 2024-12-09 | <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444> We need to create a private channel for Jenny ASAP, she joined back in April and we need to re-align expectations with her, I would recommend getting on a call, are we not actively working with her prior to transitioning to launching? She should still be in the product research phase

So immediate steps:
1) Minh / Jamie - Create private channel, share booking link and make sure Jenny books a call
2) Set expectatios with Jenny to use the private channel for all communications and remind her that the 1-1 coaching calls are available to her as an active paid student
  - 2024-12-09 | Thanks Louis I will review
  - 2024-12-07 | Regarding the NDA email, if you didn't get it by now, be sure to check spam folder...
  - 2024-12-07 | <@308107877493768193> <@297667891992723457> FYI - You should be receiving an NDA agreement via email, please take a moment to sign, the team is growing so we'll need to begin to implement this protocol
  - 2024-12-06 | <@297667891992723457> If you can't find the 1-1 coaching booking link, here it is for your convenience.

  - 2024-10-26 | @everyone I just met with Jose, he's committed but going through some challenges with a demanding work schedule (10-14 hours a day, multiple facilities), his schedule should stabilize within a month, so in the meantime we agree to the following so that he can continue to make some progress (1% a day) to maintain some momentum:

1) <@1054411267340763216> will follow-up with Jose to check-in with him once a week to make sure he is maintaining some degree of progress - no need to keep following up regarding homework and assignments until Jose schedule stabilizes
2) <@1218639416277467216> committed to consume the content in the vault, take notes and implement what he can, his focus will be to take some action in making progress with Product Research & Analysis
3) <@1218639416277467216> will not be able to attend classes due to his schedule being unpredictable, but he will leverage this dedicated private channel for questions as he reviews the content

<@1054411267340763216> Please give Jose some breathing room, he is committed to taking small actions every week to move forward, when he becomes more stable with his job's schedule, we'll ramp up and help him catch up

<@1218639416277467216> We're here to support you but we'll need you to keep us updated on your progress when Minh checks in on you, stay strong brother and do your best to stay engaged
  - 2024-10-30 | @everyone Team - Please welcome Aimy back, she is re-engaged after our conversation and is determined to build her Amazon business üí™ She is currently pursuing her real estate license in FL but is committed to the program. We will re-evaluate her membership in 6 months but let's make sure she hit her goals and find a product!

<@1054411267340763216> Aimy will book a welcome call with you to re-orient herself as the program changed significantly since she last got involved, let's follow the process and get her familiar with the new program structure, class schedule, homework, and etc.

<@701516410769375303> Let's stay committed, I want to see you post wins in the next few months üôÇ. Leverage the team as much as possible and use this private channel for support. Again, welcome back! Be sure to go through WEEK 1 modules, you got this!
  - 2024-11-01 | @everyone Team - please welcome back Anthony to active support, he had an amazing first launch and sold nearly $60k in sales back in April and had to spend 2 months to get it re-launched but the results were not the same, let‚Äôs continue to support him for the next 6 months to close the gap and get him stabilized.

<@296142820849221633> We‚Äôll revisit your active support in 6 months and discuss your options then, but let‚Äôs get you stabilized and profitable in the meantime, please book your launching call with Han ASAP, here is the booking link:

https://amzshifu.com/coach-1on1

  - 2024-12-08 | This was my first BF and definitely not my last! Sunday was my best day for sales and then I sold out midday Monday. Campaigns were paused, a few orders were cancelled by customers, the price went back up and new customers bought the remaining stock as well as my FBM units! I noticed I was also listed #40 on the Best Seller's Page for my category although I think Amazon put me in the wrong one (it's an adjacent category but I'll take all the visibility I can get). Many customers ordered 3-4 units per order which is super exciting to see. I'm working hard to improve on my next batch, excited to see what happens in 2025!
