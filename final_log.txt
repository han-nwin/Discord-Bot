  - 2024-10-31 | 
  - 2024-12-05 | Top four goals this week

- Trademark name search: trademark attorney advised me to look for more descriptive name so it has less likeliness of confusion to other existing brands. Solution: I‚Äôm using more affordable trademark name search services on Fiverr with fast turnaround time to do deep search for me. I should results back tomorrow and will talk further with my attorney to get trademark filed by end of week
- Follow up with suppliers on revised add-on products: Done!
- Start writing contract to supplier for bulk order: halfway done. Just need to finalize trademark so I can get my custom packaging and logo designed. 
- Add-on digital product: today, i have finished my digital add-on product to get more review. Just need to slap on the brand name and call it a day üòÅ
- Extra: I‚Äôm watching the whole listing creation modules again and taking careful notes on the requirements.
  - 2024-12-02 | 1. Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who are to grow alongside you and learn from them.
2. When you said you will do something tomorrow, it‚Äôs very unlikely that will happen. Do it today instead!
3. Continue growing and learning. Have some respect for yourself and level up! üöÄ
  - 2024-12-02 | Top three: 

- follow up with trademark attorney on trademark process and name search. - due tuesday
- follow up with suppliers on revised add-on products. - due Wednesday
- start writing contract to supplier for bulk order. - due Friday
  - 2024-12-01 | Reflection on goals: 
- Trademark: my first choice of word mark came back with 65% chance of having it approved by USPTO. Attorney advised to find a substitute trademark name with for more than 80% of approving by USPTO. I submitted the alternative name to the attorney. Awaiting his response and search result on Monday.
- Testing out competitors and sample products: even though not even half of the sample products came in, I have found my most preferred model of the product since it is user friendly, more functional, and sturdier than many other models. An edge on this model is it is not sold on Amazon yet while all three of my top three suppliers carry this product so I have my options opened üôÇ
 
Stage: still on Sourcing phase. 
- Once the trademark process is finalized and filed, things will get moving quicker as I am able to start creating the logo, having my designer to design a color box, and redesign my existed manychat flow toward the current product. 
- Add-ons: I‚Äôm testing out one safety feature for my current product now so it‚Äôs a bit time consuming. If by Thursday next week I could not finish the testing, i will go with my back up add-on product.
- Goal: Have everything for bulk order ready by end of this week or next week since there are still some samples have not arrived for testing. After that, I will book a call with anh Minh for verification prior to placing the order.
  - 2024-11-28 | Happy Thanksgiving everyone! It‚Äôs been an honor being a part in the Shifu family with you all! I wish us many more successes together in the future ü•≥
  - 2024-11-27 | Top 3:

1. Trademark: Getting my mark trademarked for a better price than the previous IP accelerator! Should be able to submit all paperwork by end of week.

2. Make insert card + new digital add-on product: got ideas from chatgpt and is working on a digital add-on product now.

3. Test out competitors‚Äô products: plan to test out 4 out of 5 products today.
  - 2024-11-25 | Top 3:

1. Reach out to trademark attorney regarding previous mark  with new product in a different category. I want to see if there is any other ways to move forward with this mark,l. If not, a new trademark might be required.

2. Make insert card + new digital add-on product

3. Test out competitors‚Äô products
  - 2024-11-18 | 1. Sort out all suppliers with mediocre products. Only focus on 5 suppliers with top tier product + good communication

  - 2024-12-02 | Thanks for sharing <@1168356026471436323> ! I understand some bank would not let you do balance transfer within the same bank. But if you choose a different bank to do balance transfer to, it would work.
In your case, does it work for business credit card as well?
  - 2024-11-28 | Anything that you can think of that is claimed to treat or cure something on your body can be subjected to FDA restriction  ü•≤. For me, I would still try to create a dummy listing like Minh said to see if FDA 510k clearance is required.
  - 2024-11-28 | Hi <@1261547592177811456>, I have had some experience with FDA 510k pre-approval number with my previous product. I had to let go of the previous product due to the FDA 510k number from my supplier was not sufficient for my product. 

Once you finished creating the listing, your listing will show ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù as it is still pending Seller Central‚Äôs approval. You can check back in a couple hours or the next day and the listing will likely become inactive and likely you violation report from Seller Central if the product is deemed a medical device and requires the 510k clearance number to clear it for public use. 

Many suppliers will require you to place an order or percentage of your bulk order before they can send you the 510k report. I have found a loophole to obtain the 510k number without paying but the FDA 501k number still doesn‚Äôt work. DM me if you have any question. I can guide you through it.
  - 2024-11-24 | Thank you! I have just sent you a message! üí™üèº
  - 2024-11-23 | Question: I have had a previous trademark application done for my previous potential product, but i have given it up. My current winning product is not in the same international class. Would it be recommended to file a new trademark for the new product?
  - 2024-11-11 | awesome. Will send you soon!
  - 2024-11-11 | Question about product research: When I search certain terms for a product, I get really good result for it as a potential product for me to pursue with 10-12 non-US/AMZ new sellers are doing well above $15k/month. But when I start searching for the product's generic name, I start to see 1-2 US sellers (with less than 200 reviews) that are doing well ($50-100k/month) popping up. What is the expert advise on this? Should I pursue further on this product?

  - 2024-12-05 | Hi brother Jamie, thank you for reaching out üòÅ

Here are a couple updates from me today:

1. Trademark: the brandname search continued to be a challenge for me even though i vetted USPTO and Google prior to submitting them to my attorney. But my attorney seems to always be able to find a registered brand with similar name that can have USPTO to potentially block my application. Solution: I‚Äôm seeking help from a couple gigs on Fiverr that do brand name search for me for cheaper prices ($10-$30/name). if i have better odd, I‚Äôll file trademark with the brand name right away. 

2. Digital add-on product: i‚Äôm finishing up the add-on digital ebook for my customers to get reviews from them

3. Finalizing add-ons: i just finalized add-ons for my main product as well. My suppliers are sending the addon over for me to take a look at. I have 3 suppliers for this product. One of them communicate better than the other two so i will likely go with him and keep the other 2 as reserve
  - 2024-10-28 | Another issue when it comes to starting all over again is that I have already submitted my trademark application ü•≤ This is the most costly thing I have done so far and trying to find a new product to fit under this name brand would also be a challenge.
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you <@536075832658231299> for your advice! I appreciate it!  I can see the risk of having just one supplier for your product. If anything goes wrong, I won‚Äôt be having a backup supplier.

<@975774205658411068> Hey shifu, would you be able to provide me with your thoughts on my situation? If both of you and Han lean toward the latter, I will drop the product. 

Thank you for all your help
  - 2024-10-28 | (2) Sourcing Agents: I have reached out to Macy and Elinor last week to help me source a product that has FDA 501k clearance. Thus far, Macy has not been able to locate a supplier that can offer better deal that the one I have right now. Furthermore, Macy said no other supplier can provide similar product with the FDA 501k clearance as it is difficult to obtain the certification from the FDA.

My questions are:

1. Should I move forward with this product and order the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier?
2. If ‚Äúno‚Äù is the answer to the first question, what would be recommended for the next step? Should I move away from this product? 

Thank you for all your help! I hope to hear from you soon!
  - 2024-10-28 | Hi Shifu team,

I hope you all had a great weekend! üòÜ

I‚Äôm sending out this message to update you on my listing issue prior to placing a bulk order. I‚Äôm asking for advices on if I should go ahead and purchase the FDA 501(k) clearance from our supplier so I can test out the listing?

Recap: My product is an ‚ÄúAbdominal Electrical Muscle Stimulator Belt‚Äù that requires an FDA 501(k) certification to seller in the US and on Amazon. I have done extensive research on this matter and confirmed that I will need the FDA 501(k) in order to sell this product to the public as Amazon has categorized this product as a medical device. Up to now, I have resolved all the other problems on the dummy listing except for submitting the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier to Seller Support Central

(1) Negotiation with supplier for FDA 501(k) certification: In the beginning,  my suppler wanted 50% down payment of the bulk order in order for me to obtain the FDA 501(k) clearance number to test out my listing. After a few days of negotiation, I was able to bring the price down to 30% down payment for the bulk order (which is roughly $2,500), and the supplier will not take anything less than that for the FDA 501k number. Note: This supplier owns the pattern of a product that has been selling on Amazon by another Chinese seller, and the supplier has assured me that the other Chinese seller was able to submit the same FDA 501(k) clearance number and they are currently selling the product on Amazon.
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you so much <@1054411267340763216> <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you and have a blessed day!
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi Shifu team, would anyone be able to share the sourcing agent Macy that Shifu Justin talked about? I would like to see if they can help me with sourcing out a product! üôè
  - 2024-10-21 | I did. I‚Äôll continue to follow up with them daily
  - 2024-10-21 | In your experience, would it be worth it to continue with this product since they require a lot of paper work and certification? Thanks
  - 2024-10-21 | UPDATE: The new listing became inactive right when I submitted it. I‚Äôm reading up on the regulation on the FDA regarding Electrical Muscle Stimulator. They said that this device will require 501k certification from FDA. I will have to wait for Amazon to response and then will go from there.
  - 2024-10-21 | I will try to create another listing without using any sensitive wording again to see how it goes.
  - 2024-10-21 | Yes, I did try to stay away from sensitive wording and my dummy listing has been approved for over 4-6 weeks, but just 2 days ago, Amazon Seller Central just made my listing inactive. I talked to my supplier about this issue and how one of my competitor was able to have the listing posted since they had the same model as my product. She said they were approved as they submitted further clarification paperwork and also the 501K FDA certification fromthe supplier.
  - 2024-10-19 | Here is my product: EMS belt and arm bands
  - 2024-10-19 | They said my product is for medical professional use only. But not for the public. I believe that is not true that i was able to purchase them myself. Nevertheless, i have submitted an appeal with picture of the packaging and the manual as stated in here. However, my supplier would only send me their 501k number from the FDA for their product once I placed a bulk order, and every supplier has said the same thing to me. I will wait for Amazon to respond then negotiate with my supplier that i want to order from them but it‚Äôs unreasonable to place a bulk order since i cant even sell it on amazon. I‚Äôm considering offering to put down a 3-5% deposit as good faith for the 501k number from the FDA. Would you think this approach is appropriate? <@536075832658231299> thanks for helping!
  - 2024-10-19 | Actually nevermind, all of my dummy listings have gone inactive. I‚Äôll chat further with Amazon to see how I can have it resolved. Would you recommend going with services on Fiverr to help resolve this problem? Thanks
  - 2024-10-19 | Hi anh <@1054411267340763216> thank you for answering my question about the UPC code vs the FNSKU on the dummy listing. Even after I use the service on Fiverr to convert the dummy listing to the real listing, would Amazon potentially flag me for having the product still in the restricted category? üò¨
  - 2024-10-17 | I'm on it üòÑ
  - 2024-10-17 | And just now 1 hour later Amazon approved my brand ü•≥
  - 2024-10-17 | Quick update: My supplier finished the logo-embedded product early. Just submitted Brand Registry application! ‚úÖüôåüôå
  - 2024-10-15 | Such a productive call! Thank you Anh Minh! üôå
  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks anh Minh! Booked a session for tomorrow! üôå
  - 2024-10-13 | While I was waiting for the ball to roll, I have finished the following:
- Two customized manuals for my main product and my add-on product ‚úÖ
- Insert card ‚úÖ
- 2 E-books as free gift for customers to leave review! ‚úÖ
- Instagram and Facebook page for my brand ‚úÖ
- Website Domain ‚úÖ
- Facebook Many Chat Flow to ask for reviews ‚úÖ maybe I need to do one for IG as well since many of my friends are more active on IG? 

What other suggestions would the team recommend? 

I couldn‚Äôt thank you enough for the great content and support for the past two months. I learned a lot and still have a long way to go üôå
I owe you guys each a bowl of Pho when you come to San Jose hehe ü•≥
  - 2024-10-13 | My to do list:
- Brand Registry: By the end of next week or the beginning of the week after that, I should be able to do brand registry. I will rewatch the videos in this module to refresh my knowledge. 
- Final Pricing Sheet with Supplier: I‚Äôm currently working this as well as trying to as for further discount as everything is set in place for now. 
- Barebones Listing: After Brand Registry is done, I will work on Barebones Listing to grab the FNSKU code you place it on the final packaging box. 
- Schedule a call with anh <@1054411267340763216> to go over the details (the market, my offers, pricing sheet, the contract with my supplier) before I place a bulk order. 
- Listing Creation: after all the above is done, i‚Äôll reach out to Susan for Listing creation. <@1066465177140215928> Please let me know your pricing so I can prepare ahead of time üòÅ

Is this plan sounded to the team? üòÉ
<@1054411267340763216> I would love to have the contract template ao I can start preparing it if you can share that with me üòÅ
  - 2024-10-13 | Quick recap on what i have done up to date:
- Trademark for my brand was filed Oct 3rd. After that I have my designer had been customizing my packaging and product with my brand logo on them.
- By the end of last week, I have just received my final design for the packaging box and on my product from the designer 
- I sent the design to my supplier and they will start making a sample with my logo on it (which takes about a week or so) for me to apply for brand registry.
  - 2024-10-13 | Thank you <@1066465177140215928> and <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out to me üòÅ I just finished work and heading into church now! I will update you shortly later about my current progress! üôå
  - 2024-11-18 | Top two:

1. Sort out 5 suppliers with most potential
2. Focus on Following up with suppliers with best quality products + good communication
  - 2024-10-29 | Daily too 2:

  - 2024-10-10 | <@1054411267340763216> i still cannot find my potential product despite trying the methods. Any further tips?
  - 2024-10-03 | <@1054411267340763216> If a product can be operated by battery or use cable charging, we should delete the Helium 10 listings which indicate battery and keep those with cable charging, for more accurate comparison among same products ? I am looking at a potential product with cable charging. Thanks

  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Minh, sorry I didnt join today call due to last min work issue. I submitted my potential product yesterday. Can help me take a look and give me advice? Thanks a lot!
  - 2024-10-29 | Hi Minh, I have just submitted my PR Homework for 1 potential product. Thanks
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi Minh, thanks for yr help as always! I will forgo this product and am still looking for other potential product instead.
  - 2024-10-21 | Hi Minh, thanks for analysing.

1. Moving forward, I need to submit the Product Research Tracking Sheet or Product Research Homework via airtable? I am quite confused.

2. The top AMZ with highest 1,342 counts is a AMZ resale, but there is also another AMZ seller in the middle not doing good sales. I thought it might be good.

2. As long as the top revenue sellers are from CN and US sellers are in between, it should be ok?
  - 2024-10-30 | 1. Continue to search for my potential product.
2. Finish module 1

  - 2024-11-25 | Weekly reflection: November has been a hard month for me healthwise. Have been out again the past few days due to acute nerve pain in lower back, had to go to the hospital  and was diagnosed with sciatica, which has  made it hard for me to walk, sit and stand (have been  bed-ridden past few days). Doctor said recovery could be earliest either weeks and for more serious cases, months. This has been extremely hard since the only thing I can do to manage the pain is taking pain medication until the flare ups on the nerves in my spine calm down. Have still been communicating with suppliers on Alibaba as well as talking to Macy. We both have been having issues finding suppliers since a lot of them have exclusive contracts for selling on Amazon. On a good note, was able to get the last piece needed for my dummy listing to submit the certificates needed by Amazon.
Weekly Goal:
1. Lean more into journaling/meditation since I am unable to exercise to get out the extra energy in my body
2. Submit dummy listing now that I have all the certifications needed.
3. FInalize sourcing issues with Macy & communicate with suppliers to get samples sent.
  - 2024-11-19 | Weekly reflection: Have been consistent working with finding and reaching out to suppliers everyday and verifying product criteria to make sure it matches what I am looking for when joining the market. 

Weekly Goal:
1. Finalize reaching out to suppliers and begin ordering samples.
2. Discuss with Macy my plan for batch inspections / see if she has any other suppliers she would reccomend.
3. Finish rich dad poor dad
  - 2024-11-14 | Weekly reflection: Got really sick over the weekend and finally feeling somewhat normal today. Rested a lot las few days and took a break from working since my head was in a fog. Was able to reschedule meeting with Minh, have been mostly consistent in waking up early to start sauna, & walk dog. Journaling hasn't been every day but have been getting it in more than before. Also finally found a product and spent last week finishing module 2, creating AMZ seller account, got my EIN & business CC.

Weekly Goal:
Wake up an hour earlier each day to start day with gratitude/meditation, sauna, journal & walking dog.
Work on sourcing at least 1 hour a day.

  - 2024-11-27 | I've been trying to do work arounds for that as well but have been getting it denied
  - 2024-11-27 | Thank you Minh, will try that. I've been talking to Macy and we're also speculating it may be because of FDA 510k preapproval number requirements for my product

  - 2024-11-28 | Happy thanksgiving to you all!! Truly blessed to have such a good community of people here! ü•∞
  - 2024-10-14 | United States
  - 2024-11-19 | Thank you. With the window time is it when the goods arrive at port? Or the warehouse?? Because two out of the rest have gotten to port but still has to go through customs beforehand
  - 2024-11-18 | 
  - 2024-11-18 | Am I looking at this wrong??
  - 2024-11-18 | I‚Äôm a bit worried because the ETA my freight forwarder gave me isn‚Äôt exactly accurate with time of arrival. One should‚Äôve arrived already by tomorrow but it hasn‚Äôt yet and my window was set till the 19th only..
  - 2024-11-14 | I‚Äôm assuming she could use the reference ID here?
  - 2024-11-14 | 
  - 2024-11-14 | Where exactly can I find my reference ID??
  - 2024-11-14 | She‚Äôs saying one package got to port already and needs the reference ID to make an appointment with  AMZ warehouse.
  - 2024-11-13 | Ok, thanks!
  - 2024-11-13 | Yes, I believe so.
  - 2024-11-13 | Is the reference and shipment ID different?
  - 2024-11-13 | Correct
  - 2024-11-13 | She was saying how my tracking number for the shipment was incorrect
  - 2024-11-13 | Yeah, she was asking for reference ID
  - 2024-11-13 | I am confused. Because I did sea shipping. I was not given a tracking #. I ended up using random numbers for it.
  - 2024-11-13 | Is it because when I input the tracking # I just used a series of random numbers that‚Äôs why when she checked it was wrong.
  - 2024-11-13 | My freight forwarder told me that the shipping # is wrong for the one warehouse. Is ghat something I would just fix on my side??
  - 2024-10-30 | Thank you <@308107877493768193> ! It worked for me!
  - 2024-10-30 | The tracking Id should be at least 8 characters long correct?
  - 2024-10-30 | I tried inputting random numbers and letters and it‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs not recognized.
  - 2024-10-29 | What would I put as the tracking ID if that‚Äôs the case?
  - 2024-10-29 | Yes it‚Äôs sea shipping
  - 2024-10-29 | My freight forwarder should be the one providing me with the tracking ID correct? She seems to not understand and have been giving me the FBA ID instead.
  - 2024-10-29 | Was I given the wrong information?
  - 2024-10-29 | VGT2: JCR FBA18HVMPPP9  
AVP1: JCRFBA18HVPO42S  
RDU2:  JCRFBA18HVC8NJJ 
IAH3:   JCRFBA18HVOPCOW5 
RMN3:  JCRFBA18HVHJ785Ôºå


I was given this as the tracking ID?? But it‚Äôs showing on my side that is the Amazon fba box label # not tracking ID?
  - 2024-10-16 | I'm doing all sea shipping. She was able to give me a better offer. Thanks!
  - 2024-10-16 | She was able to offer me $583 for shipping fee. Then Macy offered $125 for inspection fee. Does that sound like a reasonable price?
  - 2024-10-16 | My supplier showed me this example
  - 2024-10-16 | I saw one video , labels for shipper but doesn‚Äôt show where exactly I can go to create the label for it.
  - 2024-10-16 | Where can I get the inner box barcode label? Is there a video showing that?
  - 2024-10-15 | Okay cool. I‚Äôll wait to see what she says. Thanks!
  - 2024-10-15 | So I would just compare this with Macy and if she is able to offer inspection at a lower price I‚Äôll go with her?
  - 2024-10-15 | Just to confirm. Where it says inspection would be the total cost for inspection correct?
  - 2024-10-15 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | So then it would be a total of 10 boxes since I am doing 200 units for my first batch correct?
  - 2024-10-14 | I‚Äôm wondering if I input it correctly?
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | This is what my supplier gave me. I am a bit confused on how to input the carton of units.
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you guys!!
  - 2024-10-14 | Is there a video showing which warehouse I should be sending my products to?? I remember seeing somewhere try to send to two different warehouses??
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you!
  - 2024-10-14 | Also, since yall have experience which would save me more money. Would it be using her to do the inspection or alibaba inspection which would be the better option yall think?
  - 2024-10-14 | Macy was asking for checklist for inspection. Where can I get that?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you. I‚Äôll reach out to her!
  - 2024-10-13 | The shipping was quite pricey on supplier side so I will have the shipping agent help with as she will give me a better deal on it.
  - 2024-10-13 | My batch is ready. How do I go about inspection and who would I go to for that?
  - 2024-10-10 | Most of my friends I am asking for fbm review  are from NC. As long as they‚Äôve never used my WiFi it should be okay right? I‚Äôm wondering how much I can ask before it gets too much from the same state I‚Äôm living in..
  - 2024-10-10 | Okay, how can I schedule a call?
  - 2024-10-10 | Is there something I should be doing on the google sheet side that I'm missing??
  - 2024-10-10 | On my screen i have no options for lookup column nor lookup value? Why is that?
  - 2024-11-21 | 1.) Continue to gather FBM reviews 
2.) Watch Module videos
  - 2024-10-29 | My daily top 2: 
1. Work on finalizing shipments 
2. start research on A+ listing

  - 2024-12-06 | Meeting Report with Shifu <@975774205658411068> 

Purpose of the Meeting:
Discussion of the strategy for launching my product on Amazon and the pricing approach. Additionally, we focused on mindset and long-term goals. As <@975774205658411068>  said, "Don‚Äôt be greedy," which makes sense for setting the right goal for a sustainable long-term period.

Key Recommendations:

1. Focus on Sales Volume:
Lower the price at the start to increase sales, gather reviews, and improve organic rankings.

Operate at a breakeven point initially to build momentum, with a plan to increase the price and profitability later.

2. Tools and Strategies:
Actively use PPC and influencer marketing for promotion.
Leverage customer reviews to improve the product and its description. Based on recommendations and testing shoppable videos on Amazon from <@1213271303327453305> , I managed to find great influencerson Fivver. I can share a list of 5-star influencers privately, as well as one influencer who stole my product and is now on the blacklist.

3. What I Need to Learn:
Use Excel for profit calculations and forecasting. Numbers reveal the big picture, eliminating guesswork and calculation errors.
Conclusion:
A successful launch requires a focus on sales growth and reputation rather than immediate profitability. Pricing, customer focus, and analytics are the key elements of this strategy.
  - 2024-12-04 | 3 goals for this week

1. Build a Strong Mindset Before the Launch. Zoom Call with Justin  tomorrow. 

2. Complete Keywords for Campaign Preparation for the Zoom Call with Han tomorrow.

3. Product Launch Preparation:
Coordinate with influencers for final campaign content.
  - 2024-12-01 | Thank you dear!
  - 2024-12-01 | And I am also very glad to be your partner!

  - 2024-12-01 | These 7 months of work, with all their ups and downs, have taken all my strength and faith. At the same time, this journey has been a source of tremendous growth, big dreams, and ambitions. In just a week, I will finally launch my product, and I am looking forward to it with excitement, like the birth of a child.

I am deeply grateful to everyone who has been with me on this journey, supporting and inspiring me throughout these months.
<@975774205658411068> <@705204493620478032>  <@536075832658231299>  <@1066465177140215928>   <@1054411267340763216>  <@1213271303327453305>   <@247959041106509824>  <@308107877493768193> 

The goals are ambitious, and there is still a lot of work ahead‚Äîtasks to tackle with focus, practice, and determination. But with a team like Shifu, I am confident that everything is possible!

I have taken a week off to wrap up unfinished tasks and recharge before the launch of my product on Amazon and the intensive PPC work. Right now, I am mentally recharging by doing things that relax me, like car racing and shooting practice.

Despite being on a break, I am always connected to the Academy to stay updated on all events, communicate with the team, and continue learning.

On Monday, I‚Äôll return to my work routine, ready to take on new challenges and achieve even greater victories. Thank you all for your support!

  - 2024-11-28 | Dear Family @everyone ,
Happy Thanksgiving! May this day be filled with warmth, love, and joy. We work so hard and strive to reach our goals, but let us take a moment today to thank God for what we have and for the way He guides us forward.

"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18)

Gratitude makes the heart bigger and strengthens the spirit. I am grateful for our Academy, for the support we give each other, and for all the opportunities we have. May God's grace be with each of you!
  - 2024-11-25 | Top üíö‚ù§Ô∏èüíúü©µ Goals for this Week:
1. Finalize the product listing.
2. Prepare the mindset for the December launch.
3. Complete work with influencers: Send all necessary details to ensure the creation of high-quality videos for social platforms to effectively promote the product.
4. Try to relax emotionally during the holiday season and trust the process of the work done.
  - 2024-11-24 | Big thanks <@975774205658411068> 
For advice, contact professionals who were able to fix this problem and solve it directly with Amazon, despite the fact that I called for 3 days without stopping, nothing was resolved over the phone.
  - 2024-11-24 | My case
  - 2024-11-24 | 
  - 2024-11-24 | Amazon has certain keywords and phrases that are prohibited or restricted in listings. This is due to the platform's policy aimed at ensuring buyer safety, complying with legal regulations, and maintaining content quality.

Examples of prohibited keywords:

Marketing claims: Phrases like "100% quality guarantee," "free shipping," or "best product" are considered promotional and are not allowed in product titles and descriptions.

Special symbols and emojis: Using symbols like ‚Ñ¢, ¬Æ, ‚Ç¨, emojis, and other special characters in product descriptions is prohibited.

Claims about product properties: Terms like "antibacterial," "antimicrobial," "eco-friendly," "made of bamboo," and similar may be prohibited, especially if they are not backed by proper certifications or evidence.

Pesticide-related terms: Using terms like "pesticide," "insecticide," "repellent," "antiseptic," and similar can lead to listing suspension, especially if the product is not intended for such purposes. Amazon strictly regulates the sale of pesticide-related items, and using these terms without proper authorization may cause issues.


How to avoid using prohibited keywords:

Study Amazon's policies: Before uploading a listing, review the rules carefully. Listings can be blocked within a few hours, and access to fix them may be revoked, as was the case in my experience.

  - 2024-11-24 | Over the past few weeks, I have been actively working with influencers to increase brand awareness and prepare for upcoming sales. As part of this effort, I sent out 9 packages of my product for promotional video shoots. Each package was beautifully wrapped in festive Christmas packaging to convey a holiday spirit and evoke positive emotions from the audience.

However, I also faced a major challenge when my Amazon listing was blocked. Eight days ago, Amazon suspended my listing, and I lost access to my product. This was an incredibly stressful experience. I barely slept, as I tried every possible way to resolve the issue. I am deeply grateful to <@975774205658411068>  and <@536075832658231299>  for their guidance and support during this tough time. A special thanks to <@975774205658411068> , who remained in constant contact with me even over the weekend, patiently waiting for updates on my case. His advice on how to handle such stressful situations and create a clear action plan helped me tremendously. Thanks to that plan, I was able to find a professional who took on my case.

This morning, after eight days of struggle, my listing was finally restored. Most importantly, I managed to preserve 19 reviews, which was especially critical for me.

These events were a true test, but they taught me the importance of staying calm, trusting the team, and remembering that every problem is an opportunity for growth. I am especially grateful to the Shifu Academy not only for their technical assistance but also for their moral support. Here, I found not just knowledge but a real team that is always ready to stand by you in challenging times.

  - 2024-11-24 | 
  - 2024-11-24 | Amazon has certain keywords and phrases that are prohibited or restricted in listings. This is due to the platform's policy aimed at ensuring buyer safety, complying with legal regulations, and maintaining content quality.

Examples of prohibited keywords:

Marketing claims: Phrases like "100% quality guarantee," "free shipping," or "best product" are considered promotional and are not allowed in product titles and descriptions.

Special symbols and emojis: Using symbols like ‚Ñ¢, ¬Æ, ‚Ç¨, emojis, and other special characters in product descriptions is prohibited.

Claims about product properties: Terms like "antibacterial," "antimicrobial," "eco-friendly," "made of bamboo," and similar may be prohibited, especially if they are not backed by proper certifications or evidence.

Pesticide-related terms: Using terms like "pesticide," "insecticide," "repellent," "antiseptic," and similar can lead to listing suspension, especially if the product is not intended for such purposes. Amazon strictly regulates the sale of pesticide-related items, and using these terms without proper authorization may cause issues.


How to avoid using prohibited keywords:

Study Amazon's policies: Before uploading a listing, review the rules carefully. Listings can be blocked within a few hours, and access to fix them may be revoked, as was the case in my experience.

  - 2024-12-02 | I am grateful for the opportunity to rest and take a break from all my worries during Thanksgiving and the weekend. After such a busy year of work, it was important for me to pause, unwind, and spend time with my niece. We visited an amazing place ‚Äî a cave called "Cave Without A Name." It was an incredibly fascinating tour where we learned the captivating story of how it was discovered and why it was given that name.

Of course, no video can truly capture the beauty of God‚Äôs creation. Only the eyes can see those intricate details that fill the heart with awe.
Next week, I have important events ahead ‚Äî by the weekend, I plan to launch my product on Amazon. "Why did I begin this journey with Amazon Shifu?" I have always wanted to make my father proud. He was the closest and most cherished person in my life.

Unfortunately, he is no longer with us. Today marks exactly four years since he passed away, and December 1st will always be a painful day for me. Sometimes, I wish that day never existed, that he was still alive to say: "Daughter, I‚Äôm proud of you."

But all I can do now is cherish the happy memories of him and keep living for those who need me now ‚Äî for my family back in Ukraine.

I want to share an important message: cherish your loved ones while they are with you. Care for your parents who gave you life. Even if someone has hurt you in the past, find the strength to forgive. Live with a light heart, free from the weight of resentment.

Every day of life is a miracle. And only God knows the day and the hour. Let every new day be the beginning of a new life for each of us.

1. Go to the Help Section:
In your Amazon Seller Central account, open the Help tab.
2. Find the Get Help and Resources Section.
3. Why Not Open a Case:
Opening a case can take too long and delay the resolution. Instead, it‚Äôs more effective to call Amazon Support directly.
4. How to Prepare for the Call:

Identify the issue: For example, specify Issue with Asset for Premium A Plus.

Provide the ASIN for the product in question.

Prepare your phone number for the callback.
5. Steps to Make the Call:

Click Call me now and make sure you are near your phone.
Be ready to answer the call and explain the issue in detail.
6. Specifics of Calling Amazon Support:
In some cases, it might take multiple calls as the first consultant might not be qualified to resolve the issue.

If the consultant says they cannot help, thank them politely, hang up, and repeat the process by submitting the form again.

7. My Experience Resolving the Issue:
I had to make calls for about 4-5 hours and speak to over 15 different people before reaching the right specialist.
The specialist immediately filled out the form from their side, and within a few hours, my listing had access to Premium A Plus.
8. Advice:
Don‚Äôt give up after the first attempt. Keep calling until you reach a consultant who can assist.
Emphasize that Premium A Plus access must be updated directly on Amazon‚Äôs end.

Happy Thanksgiving! üçÇ Today, I want to sincerely thank each of you for your hard work, wisdom, and incredible support that have made my growth in our Academy possible.

Each of you is special in your own way, and your willingness to help, even in the most challenging situations, helps me feel that I am not alone.

For the past seven months, I have not told my family about what I‚Äôve been working on. This entire journey has been my personal decision and adventure. Being a part of our Academy has been a tremendous source of support, inspiration, and faith that I am on the right path.

You have given me confidence, surrounded me with understanding, and created an atmosphere where I can learn and grow. Thank you for everything you do!

May the Lord abundantly bless you and your families, filling your hearts with peace, joy, and gratitude. May all your dreams and prayers be heard, and may your lives shine brightly as a source of light, inspiration, and kindness for those around you. I wish you strong faith, love, and countless blessings.

With love,
Olesia Hall

  - 2024-11-12 | 8. My last tips. With the holidays and Christmas approaching, every buyer wants their purchase to look giftable. So I send products to influencers in Christmas gift packaging and include instructions to make the video more engaging, with an emphasis on the product‚Äôs giftable presentation. This is my personal preference ‚Äî for the product to look attractive and eye-catching in the ads.
  - 2024-11-12 | After working with influencers for two months and communicating with them, I can share my experience. By sending emails and direct messages to accounts and communicating with over a hundred people, I saw the mistakes I made. I want to share the tips that helped me now and that may be useful for those working with influencers in this field to understand the strategy that worked for me, based on my own mistakes.

1. I realized that when you approach influencers as a brand founder, it often leads to higher pricing. This is very similar to the experience with suppliers in China. When you mention that you have a boss and are just an employee, they begin to behave differently, more grounded. Experience has shown that influencers are people just like me, and they also want to earn money. However, they respond more humanely if they know I‚Äôm an employee and need my boss‚Äôs approval on the price.


2. While reviewing and studying each influencer‚Äôs page, I noticed that many of them are already part of the Amazon Affiliate program, which allows them to create links to products for promotion and receive commissions on each sale. However, many influencers I spoke with were either unaware of this program or thought that joining was very difficult. So, I prepared a step-by-step presentation for them on how to register for this program. If any students need this information, I can share it. The presentation is in English, and in it, I outlined the earning potential, the opportunities Amazon offers, and that the Amazon Affiliate program is entirely free for influencers. This also shows influencers that we are committed to a trusted partnership by providing full instructions for proper registration.


3. After registering in the Amazon Affiliate program and accessing the Site Stripe dashboard, influencers can see how many purchases were made via the link they placed in their content. In the contract between influencers and the brand, I added a recommendation to register platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok. This will help them earn more and develop their content.


4. Amazon Attribution is a very user-friendly program. The 10% bonus is applied as a reduction on your referral fees and bonus program for your Influencers. 
Creating campaigns in it is also straightforward. However, there are a few important points to consider when creating links. You need to go to Seller Central > Advertising > Campaign Manager and select Amazon Ads. Next, you should click on "Measurement Reporting" ‚Äî this will take us to the Amazon Attribution page, where you can create an ad campaign (click "Create Campaign"). It‚Äôs fairly easy to fill out, but I recommend using the manual mode for greater accuracy. Also, it‚Äôs essential to correctly copy the link to your Amazon listing: you don‚Äôt need to paste the entire link with keywords ‚Äî just end it with the ASIN and the "/" symbol. This link is entered in the URL field of the campaign and group you create. Save the changes at the top and create the campaign.
5. Only after creating the campaign and subgroup will you see Attribution Tags on the dashboard for each campaign group. These long Attribution Tags are used to place ads on influencer pages, as well as on your pages and in content where you will be advertising and tracking data.
6. If you‚Äôre creating a campaign with 1 to 5 groups (for example, for 5 influencers, each requiring a separate link), I recommend naming each group after the respective influencer. This will help you know exactly which influencers are making the most impact on your sales. You can also record the date they posted your ad, making it easier to provide data and calculate bonus commissions on their sales.
7. For convenience, I created a Word document where I save all Attribution links for each piece of content: Instagram, Facebook, website, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter. Each group is labeled with the influencer‚Äôs name, so I have quick access to information and a more organized process.

  - 2024-12-04 | I asked amz to send it back to me. Some of them still looks brand new and haven‚Äôt been used for some reason. I guess customer just bought it and changed their mind and decided to return it. (But still shows as unfulfillable in your seller account)

I sold 4 units at FBM price by combining some of the add ons and main unit.
  - 2024-12-02 | That‚Äôs good! I thought it‚Äôs just a lost unit and no reimbursement haha. I did get reimbursement for 1 of the unit that customer did not return. Thank you brother!
  - 2024-12-02 | If it says "return not expected" does this mean the customer did not return the product to amazon and they have been refunded as well?
  - 2024-11-15 | I had the stock with me. I asked AMZ to send it back to me so I can close my listing. Feels weird to pack your own product and send it to customer hahaha. It was my first time lol.
  - 2024-11-15 | this happened to me too. I left my FBM open for FBM  F&F reviews and also because I have 2 units left from my 1st batch which I withdraw from AMZ warehouse. Then 2 random buyers bought those 2 units for FBM price. Just hoping that they are not hijackers lol
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Shifu, just to clarify. Is it okay to not do the storefront? And for your question, I did enroll for brand registry through suggested IP accelerator on amazon. üôÇ
  - 2024-11-15 | I just realized after watching Wed class, I don't have a storefront yet. Can someone teach me how to do it? Or is there any video/module that explains how to do it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Thanka shifu. I had it sorted out. I called paypal.
  - 2024-11-13 | I helped with fbm purchase with one of the mentees and she paid me via paypal.  I received the payment but I also got this email about holding the payment.

My main concern is, this is not related with my business. Will this affect me during tax audits?

Thank you.

  - 2024-11-15 | I had the stock with me. I asked AMZ to send it back to me so I can close my listing. Feels weird to pack your own product and send it to customer hahaha. It was my first time lol.
  - 2024-11-15 | this happened to me too. I left my FBM open for FBM  F&F reviews and also because I have 2 units left from my 1st batch which I withdraw from AMZ warehouse. Then 2 random buyers bought those 2 units for FBM price. Just hoping that they are not hijackers lol
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Shifu, just to clarify. Is it okay to not do the storefront? And for your question, I did enroll for brand registry through suggested IP accelerator on amazon. üôÇ
  - 2024-11-15 | I just realized after watching Wed class, I don't have a storefront yet. Can someone teach me how to do it? Or is there any video/module that explains how to do it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Thanka shifu. I had it sorted out. I called paypal.
  - 2024-11-13 | I helped with fbm purchase with one of the mentees and she paid me via paypal.  I received the payment but I also got this email about holding the payment.

  - 2024-09-29 | Is this the csv file? You download this from campaign manager. Then you can send it via airtable using ppc assistant tool and they will adjust it for you.
  - 2024-09-29 | I think they said you need to make a copy and do not edit on the original copy.
  - 2024-09-29 | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pYbt28elEQTrcRylxdCUKZi3hZgJ2fq6g6RetU_hnlQ/edit#gid=0
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-11-15 | If I am still out of stock. Can I skip this homework for now and just do it once I have my 2nd batch?
  - 2024-10-28 | Got it. Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-10-28 | I did. Also, ACOS there says 7k+ Whereas, when I use campaign manager from amazon seller account, it is only 5k+.. (after I filter the date range from launch date to the day I closed my listing)
  - 2024-10-28 | So when computing it manually. Do we just deduct COGS and shipping from payout? (Payout minus COGS + shipping) ??
  - 2024-10-28 | But the payout from amazon.. Do they deduct already the ACOS, seller fees, refunds, and coupon discounts?
  - 2024-10-28 | I did, it says 4.2k in net profit. Shifu Justin just told me to do this method because sometimes, the sellerboard data might be inaccurate or not updated yet?
  - 2024-10-28 | Just 300 USD left... Is it negative 8k because I deduct the 15k from (amazon fees, coupon, ACOS, refunds) where it was deducted already before sending the direct deposit to me?
  - 2024-10-28 | Shifu Justin told me to do this to keep track on my profit/expenses. I feel like I am doing something wrong because my net profit is negative. Did I deduct too much? meaning = Amazon already deducted it from the payout and I deducted more during my computation? Thank you in advance for helping me figure out the math lol
  - 2024-10-27 | Yes, it was all set. I messaged Tom and he reminded Justin. He was just in another meeting. Thank you!
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi, Shifu Justin scheduled a meeting today with me at 1:30 but he is not on our zoom call yet. Can someone remind him? Or do we need to reschedule? thank you..
  - 2024-10-25 | Thank you Shifu. Can I go ahead and send FBA labels to my supplier?
  - 2024-10-25 | I did not update the warning mentioned because I don‚Äôt see any ‚Äúred‚Äù items that I need to update except for the listing price. After I updated the price, it is active now.

Should I go ahead and close it now? Or find the warning that they are telling?
  - 2024-10-25 | Now it says active, should I close the listing first while out of stock? shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-25 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> , I followed your video recording. My listing is back but it has some warnings/errors.. Please see the screenshot and let me know if there is anything I need to do?
  - 2024-10-25 | Okay. But the main reason I deleted my listing will be fixed? The fluid oz issue and the subscribe and save? 

Does it take 24 hours for my listing to be active again or more than 24 hours?
  - 2024-10-25 | Thank you for this. I will complete this tomorrow. When I submit this, is my listing back to normal? I don‚Äôt need to reupload the images? Videos? Bullet points?
  - 2024-10-25 | Oh no, time for an upgrade shifu. Maybe a urus like shifu justin haha
  - 2024-10-25 | No worries. Hope your car is doing good now.
  - 2024-10-24 | Shifu <@536075832658231299>  are we still meeting today or are you just going to send a recording?
  - 2024-10-24 | Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-10-24 | Shifu <@536075832658231299>  I will just send it here, there is a lot to screenshot on template tab and I might miss something. If you can make it tomorrow, is it the same time 5pm EST?
  - 2024-10-23 | Will send it to you once I get home. Thank you!
  - 2024-10-23 | Let me know what day works for you.
  - 2024-10-23 | shifu <@536075832658231299>  My excel is now working.
  - 2024-10-23 | yes
  - 2024-10-23 | got it. I can wait. No worries. üôÇ
  - 2024-10-23 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> can you send the link for our 1on1 today?
  - 2024-10-21 | It is for fixing my listing. Correcting the "Fl oz" for unit count type because it confuses some of the customers thinking it is a liquid product. Also removing the subscribe and save option because this option seems for a product that needs replenishment every month like a liquid product..
  - 2024-10-21 | October 23rd? 5pm EST?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you shifu. Is there like a tracking number that we can monitor?
  - 2024-10-14 | They will just ship it to me?
  - 2024-10-14 | Is it this one shifu? Then just click review?
  - 2024-10-14 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> , now it is showing up. How do I request withdrawals to send the units back to my address?
  - 2024-10-14 | Okay, I closed the listing. I will wait for a few minutes/hours as the "stranded inventory" is still not showing up so far.
  - 2024-10-14 | Sorry shifu, can you further explain? 

Based from my understanding. Close the listing and ask amazon to send the units back to me? I am US based by the way.
  - 2024-10-14 | Or maybe, I can just save it for mcf orders if a customer requests a new unit? In case 1 unit is defective‚Ä¶
  - 2024-10-14 | Not until January.. they just started production a week ago. 

Should I close it still?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you. After I sold this 2 unit. Should I go ahead and close it again?
  - 2024-10-14 | I reopened it today. They just sent me an email today about that 2 units. Is it correct that I reopened it?
  - 2024-10-14 | Now it's saying I have 2 units available?
  - 2024-10-14 | Good morning.

Can someone help me with this? I‚Äôm pretty sure I sold out but wondering why it says stranded. Did I close my listing too early? Do I need to reactivate it? When I closed the listing before it says ‚Äú0‚Äù available but there are still some units under ‚ÄúFC processing‚Äù
  - 2024-10-11 | Okay. I will tell them about the FBA label. But FNSKU, I can give them the old one and stick it on each unit packaging already?
  - 2024-10-11 | Not yet, they just want to get it to avoid delays. That's what they told me. But FBA labels are just outside of the cartons right?
  - 2024-10-11 | Okay, I will tell them to use the same FSNKU. What about the shipping label? Can I create one already or should I wait after our call?
  - 2024-10-11 | Hi shifu, just to make sure the only available dates are 10/21-10/24 right?
  - 2024-10-11 | Just tell them use the same FSNKU code? Will it be the same if I change my product title? Me and susan were trying to change it pre-launched but amazon is giving us an error.
  - 2024-11-07 | 1. Send FBA label to supplier 2. Watch class recording for Wed

  - 2024-12-05 | I hope this message finds you all well. I want to sincerely apologize for my delayed responses. The past few weeks have been quite busy with work, and on top of that, my wife and I had a series of hospital follow-ups. Thankfully, everything is going well, and I‚Äôm thrilled to share some wonderful news, we welcomed our baby into the world earlier than expected! While we were preparing for a December 20th due date, our little one arrived on the 2nd, and we were released from the hospital just yesterday.
This new chapter in my life has brought a renewed sense of motivation. With my growing family, I‚Äôm inspired to cherish every moment and strive for greater things. Thank you all for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate it. Let‚Äôs continue moving forward together! üôèüí™

  - 2024-04-24 | To prevent from conflicting information as I am about to set up my Amazon US and will ask for business address.
  - 2024-04-24 | Do you use your residential address as your business address? Yes, I watched the video but I think it was not covered or tackled. This is for the uniformity of the addresses

  - 2024-12-04 | Thank you! Even if I have different variations?
  - 2024-12-04 | When you are purchasing upc codes from GS1, do you need an individual barcode for EACH piece of inventory? It looks like if I need 100 codes it‚Äôs cost hundreds of dollars? Is this correct?

  - 2024-11-12 | Thank you so much!
  - 2024-11-12 | <@308107877493768193> thank you. That helps out. So I would need my supplier to go ahead and separate  to ship to different locations?
  - 2024-11-12 | <@536075832658231299> you had mentioned that one box should not be over 50 pounds. Is that correct? Also, it‚Äôs better to ship to 5 different warehouses so that it will speed up the process at the warehouse and also cost less? Is that right? Just want to make sure I understood correctly? üòÄ

  - 2024-12-04 | Happy holidays everyone! Hope everyone BF and cyber Monday was good! Compared to prime day, BF day and cyber Monday was much better than the other 9 days. After speaking to Justin I wanted to give others in the community hope there is light at the end of this long tunnel. Trust the process. Just know, not every day is going to be a good day but if you keep showing up for yourself there will be many good days. ‚ò∫Ô∏è I was about to give up on my product as other days was 0-3 sales a day but I worked on improving the product and asked Justin, Chloe, Louis, Kay, Olesia and Phuong for help when I was struggling. I appreciate  everyone support on their journey üôèüèº I hope I can give others motivation to keep going.

  - 2024-08-09 | does PPC work like an auction? Where if you bid more conservatively like suggested $3 you do $2 the other guy bids $3, $3.5, $4 will be above you on the key word search? Also running a ppc campaign does it shows up as sponsor right? the ones that show up without sponsor ranked organically?
  - 2024-08-08 | Got it makes sense thanks for explaining!
  - 2024-08-08 | What does CPR stand for? I googled it it says cerebro product rank so then the lower the better right? But then <@536075832658231299> PPC video says it stands for "the number of sales in the last 8 days" so then that means the higher the number the better??
  - 2024-11-04 | Yes, let me join in. I‚Äôm gonna start attending Wednesday‚Äôs class this week.

  - 2024-10-17 | That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm afraid of too. It‚Äôs my first time working with an influencer. How do you usually pay them through Zelle?

  - 2024-10-17 | Hi, I was wondering I got an influencer and she is asking for 300 hundred dollars for a I plan to ship her out the product. Do you usually pay them after or before they make the video she is asking me to pay her before she makes a video.

I have a question about a Vine customer said their product isn‚Äôt working even after charging for 4 hours. Should I have them return it to Amazon or my business address for a replacement to avoid a bad review?
Thank u

  - 2024-10-13 | I see what you're saying, the keywords with high impressions are the one I bid higher compared to the other
  - 2024-10-13 | 
  - 2024-10-13 | Means thoes keyword have no impression
  - 2024-10-13 | I just submitted a request for PPC assistance, and after reviewing the report for the last 15 days, I noticed that most of my keywords are not performing well. Only 2 or 3 keywords and product targeting have high impressions and a few sales since the launch. % ACOS is really high. Should I target new keywords? Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  - 2024-10-13 | Alright I see. Thank you

  - 2024-10-26 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> , 

Sorry Idk why I didn‚Äôt get this notification but yea so I filed my trademark using a third party service like how I filed my llc through legalzoom. Just to save money and just having small issues back and forth. Overall just been slow process for me because I had to await samples and now feedbacks from friends/family. Once my trademark is straightened up, I will complete my brand registry

  - 2024-03-05 | Yea I thought about it too. But decided that it was a bit overkill so I went ahead with the quick USPTO search
  - 2024-02-15 | Probably just cause LegalZoom is kinda sketchy with how they present their services. A lot of their add ons when intiailly signed up for an LLC could be done for free or optional lol
But this sounds like one of those services that's worth spending money on to save you time. good suggestion, <@1112578451816321157>

  - 2024-11-11 | 
  - 2024-11-11 | My Name is Jenn O. and I am a photographer, videographer and run a photobooth business. I live in Los Angeles CA and my hobbies are going to music festivals, being outdoors in nature, trying new things, exploring food and traveling the world. 

My vision for my life is to be have financial stability and ultimately be able to experience life with the people I love since I never had that growing up. My current position in the service industry is taking away the opportunity for me to make money while I‚Äôm not there. I‚Äôm committed to diversifying my income so that I can provide stability for my future. Also I want to be able to provide stability and peace for my mother who is getting old in korea and I want to be able to give back 10 folds. 

My goals in the next 1-2 years is to have my first amazon shop set up or even two! Also to move my home office for photography into studio/warehouse in 1 year. Also another big goal in 2 years is to have saved enough money for a house.

What I would tell my future self when I am successful and looking back at my journey is that I am proud of you for sticking to your commitment and vision. I‚Äôm proud that you stayed consistent, trusted the process and made the necessary sacrifices to be where you are today.

What I would tell myself when I am encountering difficulty so I don‚Äôt give up is that it‚Äôs okay to not know everything and that there is support around me if I ask. Also not to regret letting more time pass by cause my younger self deserve to have what I‚Äôve always envisioned for me!
  - 2024-12-03 | Sheeeesh üî•
  - 2024-12-01 | Wow that‚Äôs amazing <@1054411267340763216> !
  - 2024-11-28 | Hey guys! Happy thanksgiving! 
A few of my friends and I are putting a toy drive for the foster kids in LA. Even a football or small contribution goes a long way to possibly spark some inspiration to these kids! There‚Äôs strength in numbers so we would love any support! 

The whole goal is to pay it forward and give away what we want for ourselves. ü§ç

I know some of you aren‚Äôt in LA but we plan to take advantage of the Black Friday sale and you can ship it to me and I‚Äôll make sure it gets delivered! 

We will be collecting up until Dec 8th. I‚Äôll post up all the photos from our toy drives  for you guys! If you are interested pls reach out and I‚Äôll give you more information!!!  Thanks again <@975774205658411068> for just giving us the platform to win in all aspects in our lives!

It's normal to have a high return rate with the 1st n 2nd batch. Amazon can still sell returned products, or if they‚Äôre unfulfilled, they‚Äôll send them back to us or our 3PL, we can repackage and sell them as FBM or resend them to Amazon for resale. The only thing we can do is focus on improving the product and updating the listing images . My return rate was more than 15%, and I know others with rates as high as 25%. The return rate will drops as you get more reviews and after product improvement. I've even received unopened, brand-new returns marked as "not working." ü§£ Sometimes, people just enjoy buying things and then returning them. I hope this makes you feel betterü´∂ üòÅ

  - 2024-11-16 | Thank you <@975774205658411068>  for sharing informationüôÇ  I would recommend Larry for this service, since I think doing FBM orders for reviews can be risky. Some of you may not want to leak the product, or you might not have family members live in US to help out. Many of the mentee accounts here have a long buying history, but they rarely leave product reviews, and start leaving reviews for new accounts, which Amazon could track it (as inappropriate). Asking them for help could increase the chances of your listing getting blocked, or even their account being flagged, which could also affect our selling account. However, keep in mind that this service is a bit pricey since you have to pay everything upfront.

  - 2024-11-16 | For anyone interested in a product that requires FDA approval but doesn‚Äôt have it- You can try, but there‚Äôs no guarantee. Hiring someone on Fiverr to help write the product description, bullet points, and anything else related to the product. Test it to see if Amazon flags it. Keep trying until Amazon approves the listing.

Make sure to explain your situation to the freelancer and ask if they can help update the listing description until it gets approved, but clarify this before paying them for the work. AGAIN YOU CAN TRY BUT NO WARRANTEEüôÇ

  - 2024-12-04 | Hi all, I want to share some tips part 2üòÇ 

If you've had your listing done but don't like it, or if you want to change it to match a seasonal theme on a short budget, or if you're having trouble finding a good listing agent to redo it, here's what I find helpful.

Ask your listing agent for all the product photos and 3D images (or any other images) with a white background.
(You can use a tool like PhotoRoom to remove the background, but for me, it's not ideal since it doesn't allow me to control what to keep or remove from the image.- still learning how to use it correctly)

Use Canva to edit or change the theme of your listing images, and/or RESIZE them for premium A+ content.

This way, you can save money and customize your listing exactly how you want it. Of course, you can't change the entire listing this way, but it can help you improve and update certain parts without breaking the bank. This is just an example but at least make listing image look more appealing
  - 2024-12-04 | For anyone newly launching a product on H10, I find the Xray Keywords feature extremely helpful. You can run Xray Keywords on competitor listings to find performance keywords that are generating sales for the product. By adding these keywords to your PPC campaigns, you can leverage competitor data to boost sales of your own product.
If you have the H10 Diamond Plan, you can also see the competitor's bids for each keyword, giving you even more insights to optimize your PPC strategy.

  - 2024-11-11 | üôèüèºüò¨
  - 2024-11-11 | And about storing goods in a 3PL warehouse and then shipping them to a nearby Amazon warehouse. I don‚Äôt understand if we order too much for small business like me. I can't generate enough cash flow because we have too much inventory in the warehouse. Also, is there really a significant difference between storing goods in an Amazon warehouse and a 3PL? Usually, we‚Äôre still able to sell those batches within three months to avoid extra fees on top? And those fees are tax write off. And during the holidays, even when we send inventory to Amazon, it still takes a while for them to receive it. So, what‚Äôs the benefit of storing in a warehouse and shipping to Amazon later?
  - 2024-11-11 | Is it normal to keep negotiating the price? I always negotiate the price down every time I place an order. I still want to maintain a good relationship and make sure I‚Äôm doing it right, at least ensuring they feel comfortable. When should we stop negotiating the price with the manufacturer?
  - 2024-11-11 | Hi everyone, can you please give me some advice? I‚Äôm thinking of switching to FBM to reduce fees, but I‚Äôm concerned that it means we‚Äôll have to handle all customer service and returns, which would require hiring someone to be available 24/7 to manage these issues. I still prefer FBA since it‚Äôs managed by Amazon and includes Prime shipping, but is there a way to reduce the fees? Or should we consider a mix of FBM and FBA? Also, when we start selling on other platforms in the future, we‚Äôll still use a 3PL for storage and shipping, right?
  - 2024-11-08 | Sorry Jamie and everyone I just get busy around holiday time and totally lost track of time. It‚Äôs just too much on my hands right now. I can‚Äôt even join any classes during the week. But I will try my best to catch up and turn in hw on time ü•≤

  - 2024-11-07 | Because it‚Äôs holiday season so i thought it would be a great time to sell and test the product. But that‚Äôs one really frustrating ü•≤

I've tested a bunch of kws, tried lowering the price, and even raised bids (which were already high), but I still can't get impressions. Do you recommend any way to fix this?üòî
  - 2024-11-05 | I'll sort everything out in the document and send you a copy. I need to do more research and get ideas from other Shopify stores. Thank you so much for your advice, Susan.ü´∂
  - 2024-11-02 | Hi Susan, so how does it work? I thoguht we just send the product over and they will take picture of it? I am not sure how many pics do we need for shopify?

  - 2024-11-30 | I couldn't create a variation the traditional way. Has anyone created a variation using feeds? Can you help me walk through it, please?
  - 2024-11-30 | Hi <@1213271303327453305> I'm little confuse on this. Do you mind helping me create this link please? Not sure I did something wrong? ü•π

  - 2024-11-21 | gotchaaa do I need to ask AMZ about the reserved qty ? to see what the hold up is?
  - 2024-11-21 | then wait until I get re-stocked and work on FBM ?
  - 2024-11-21 | so once technically sold out..... do I turn off all campigns?
  - 2024-11-21 | right??? idk either

  - 2024-10-27 | Hi Jamie! I've finished inventory #1 HW and will submit over as I'm still working on #2 and #3. For the data visibility.... my campaigns are set to start on Wednesday 10/30 so once I gather the data I will submit over but you said I can just submit once and update weekly right?

  - 2024-11-21 | I didn't wait so I can prepare for the first day of the sales tomorrow
  - 2024-11-20 | I tried and it still doesn't update the Title. I will try the delete and reupload spreadsheet method again after prime Week.
  - 2024-11-15 | Okay got it. Thank you
  - 2024-11-15 | Ah that was my mistake. I searched and used my original one.
  - 2024-11-15 | And you search your product right?
  - 2024-11-15 | This should be the spreadsheet that says ‚Äúadd a product that is already listed‚Äù?
  - 2024-11-15 | Okay I deleted it. I‚Äôll wait another 24 hours to redo it and upload a blank spreadsheet to see what red outline ones are needed
  - 2024-11-15 | I just went to inventory and somehow the spreadsheet created my listing. I still have the OLD title eventhough I uploaded a spreadsheet after 24 hours
  - 2024-11-15 | I am trying to upload the Spreadsheet and I have these 2 errors.
1. I put in my exact inventory. What would this require? or do I put 0?
2. Do I make a new SKU? I ran it with the SKU they provided, then I Ran another one with my old SKU. Both gave me these errors
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-13 | I see okay. I can do that
  - 2024-11-13 | okay. So delete first then reupload the spreadsheet? or vice versa?
  - 2024-11-13 | what about the current inventory that has the ASIN printed on them?
  - 2024-11-13 | this has to create a new ASIN?
  - 2024-11-13 | wouldn't it be a lot faster?
  - 2024-11-13 | curious to know why the "copy" listing doesnt work better?
  - 2024-11-13 | okay I will try that out
  - 2024-11-13 | correct
  - 2024-11-13 | or close it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Create a new one then delete the old one?
  - 2024-11-13 | no I dont have to
  - 2024-11-13 | and create a new listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | so I will update all the info and type it in
  - 2024-11-13 | but I didn't copy everything over. I just tried to refresh the current one
  - 2024-11-13 | I did it yesterday with the partial update
  - 2024-11-13 | Okay. I will do that
  - 2024-11-13 | Hmm so far out. Let me try to do it on my own first lol. So I can adjust it before this weekend
  - 2024-11-07 | I wasn‚Äôt able to attend his class yesterday so I didn‚Äôt get a chance to send anything in yet. 

I am still in the process of moving  some of my work schedules around for the weekly meeting
  - 2024-11-01 | Thank you! I‚Äôm glad to be back and in need of some help. I‚Äôm already working on some tips Justin has given me and seeing how that goes in the next couple of weeks

In my country we don‚Äôt celebrate thanksgiving but I can guess it‚Äôs a day to celebrate all the things we are grateful for. As many here, I am grateful and blessed to be part of this fammunity, a lot of lovely people and great coaches. Also thankful for mom for giving me a strong body, this body that doesn‚Äôt get sick a lot and really enduring so I can still have energy to balance and do all the things that needs to be done.  Lastly., I am thankful for God for everything I have and pray for everyday. 

My top 3 goals for the week:
1. this week I got 3 organic reviews üëèüèªüëèüèª and continuing to provide customer service.
2. Got 2 fbm purchases, just need one more before the end of the week to reach my goal. Apart from the organic reviews, 2 more reviews from f&f
3. Posted 2 short videos on YouTube and other social medias 
4. I started PPC hw4 but I need to finish it for this weekü•≤

This week was tough for me , my baby was sick for 3-4 days with fever and diarrhea and later I also got sick for 3 days because I couldn‚Äôt take care of myself while taking care of her. But something good , I got a 4 star vine review which is a win for me üôåüèªüôåüèª lastly began watching module 7 on influencers marketing, a lot of new topics and consideration for my next year strategy plan. 

My goals this week following my strategy plan
1. Happy to say I got 2 organic reviews this week ( it really helped adding to the flow the part where customers don‚Äôt leave review the first try and automatic message about the gift expiring motivated them to leave the review). As well as following on customers asking how is the product going and getting feedback.‚úÖ
2. This week only got 3 fbm sales( my goal is 3-5 so it‚Äôs good)‚úÖ
3. Added one YouTube short video for this week (which I leverage and post on TikTok, IG, fb also)‚úÖ

Reported another VP review from competitors. They use the same tactic, first upload a 4 stars review with a picture of another similar product. When it‚Äôs published, they will change it to 1 star then delete the picture. Same tactic. Also being super busy with my baby as she is having diarrhea and fever this week. The fever is no more but the diarrhea it‚Äôs still on. I am closely communicating with her doctor because we don‚Äôt want her to be dehydrated. It‚Äôs painful to see her in pain. Wishing tomorrow she can get better. 
This week I was able to accomplish all my goals except for having one more organic review from customerüò≠ I guess I have to reward myself with 50 squats

Happy to say that I completely filled out a notebook with important tips and lessons from the vault and classes since the beginning. Had to buy another for my journey post launch. I am not selling any notebook not even for 1 billion dollars so don‚Äôt ask üòÇ
Goals of the week
1. Optimized many chat flow. After it, got another one organic review  from customer. Working on to get one more to reach my goal of 2-4 a week by following up with customers ‚úÖ
2. Already have 6 f&f and mentees that bought altogether for future fbm reviews for this week‚úÖ
3. Optimize ppc for today 
4. Created YouTube brand channel. Posted 4 vertical shorts‚úÖ
5. Pending to create separate listing. Will do it by end of week
  - 2024-11-12 | It means I should create a new listing with a different ASIN in case I can‚Äôt save my current one if I keep on getting targeted
  - 2024-11-12 | November 12, 2024 
This past week I have been bombarded with bad reviews from competitors but it‚Äôs okay this is part of the journey. Had a call with shifu Justin to help me clear my mind and give me better insights on what to improve and strategies advices. These are the key points, goals and mindsets I have set for myself. Hope this may also be helpful for others on the same stage üôè

  - 2024-12-03 | How come I first had over 300 units sold then suddenly it dropped to around 270? Is there a reason to this ? If I sum the sold stock and all the unfulfillable, fc transfer , available stock doesn‚Äôt match the total amount I initially ordered ü§îü§î

  - 2024-11-05 | And what if I already set bid to be 0.20, still not generation sales but spending 100+ , what should be we in this case ?
  - 2024-11-05 | <@536075832658231299> for example, if there is 30 clicks, no sales and the cpc Is lower than the suggested bid, why do we want to keep it the same ?
  - 2024-11-18 | Ok will work on that
  - 2024-11-18 | I am also trying to run another coupon with the new price of 99.99 by offering 5% discount, but the system won‚Äôt allow because now the price with coupon is 94.99 and they want it to be 92.14 because it was the lowest price with coupon before the change. Does this mean I cant put coupon unless I want to lower it to 92.14?
  - 2024-11-18 | Hello shifus, should I worry about the return rate ?
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok I will still analyze the ranking of kws
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok will do
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok
  - 2024-11-15 | 96.99
  - 2024-11-15 | I was thinking about this , maybe increasing to 99.99 first to test it out for a week. I am on my last 200 units and next batch will come on late December or beginning of January
  - 2024-11-14 | ok done

  - 2024-10-17 | I think i booked it wrong
  - 2024-10-17 | Hello Han
  - 2024-10-14 | üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
  - 2024-10-14 | Is one a month enough ?
  - 2024-10-14 | Ok so I will have to have friends keep on buying from fbm
  - 2024-10-14 | So I should have 1 unit for FBM at 30% higher price ?
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-22 | I am newly launched but sure I will help where I can
  - 2024-10-22 | Hey I am also en ENFPüî•üî•
  - 2024-11-12 | My top 2:
1. work on YouTube shorts 
2. Gathering fbm reviews
  - 2024-11-12 | There is PPC hw4??? Where can I find it üò≠
  - 2024-11-07 | 1. Sent gift card for customer leaving review 
2. Answered customer email for help
  - 2024-11-15 | TikTok
  - 2024-11-06 | Is there any other way for this ? I can‚Äôt put -20% discount
  - 2024-11-03 | If my status for back Friday event is ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù does it means it‚Äôs active ? Also just to make sure the minimum discount should be 5%? (It‚Äôs not the amount I am offering but just to know the numbers)
  - 2024-11-03 | yes, try using google chrome or another browser
  - 2024-11-03 | Thank you Susan üôè
  - 2024-11-03 | Han is there a tutorial on how to do it ? I didn‚Äôt got the chance for prime day so I am not sure how to do it correctly
  - 2024-11-02 | Did you try that method ?
  - 2024-11-02 | Hahahahha
  - 2024-11-02 | Emmmmmmmmmmm got me thinking
  - 2024-11-02 | What I see is that they do leave the higher price up and sell some units but mostly they keep on making the limited deal
  - 2024-11-02 | I just got an idea: isn‚Äôt better to list our selling price high, then run limited time deals so We will be in the limited deal category, have the limited badge and wont  need to increase the price just keep on running deals. Can someone give me opinions on this ? Thoughts, pros and cons I may be missing?
  - 2024-11-01 | Yes , a lot of impressions and a lot of clicks

  - 2024-11-28 | Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I am beyond grateful for crossing path‚Äôs with the Shifu‚Äôs and joining this amazing family. You are all very inspiring and uplifting and I am thankful for you all. Have an amazing day!
  - 2024-12-03 | Ah I see. So I looked through Amazon seller forums and from what I gathered, it could be that some orders may have been cancelled after ordering or payments from buyers didn‚Äôt go through resulting in cancellation. Which Amazon then adjusts the sales data accordingly.

However this doesn‚Äôt explain why your totals don‚Äôt match up to your original inventory count. So I‚Äôm not too sure about that part.
  - 2024-12-03 | Hi <@613172337470341150>, just to clarify, are you saying you already sold 300 units but now it says you sold 270 units? Or that you ordered 300 units and sold 270 so you‚Äôre missing 30 units?

You can see if there are any shipment discrepancies in the ‚ÄúManage FBM Shipments‚Äù tab. If there are any missing units, Amazon will reimburse you for the COGS. If they find the missing units later then they will revert the reimbursement.
  - 2024-12-02 | Hi Engel, yes, the customer doesn‚Äôt have to return the item and they still get refunded. But if they don‚Äôt return it, then after 60 days Amazon will reimburse you for it.
  - 2024-12-02 | Good thinking!
  - 2024-12-02 | I‚Äôve reached out to customers that return products just to try to avoid a bad review üòÖ

It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to message them to try and send them the missing part. Just be careful with asking them to change their review.
  - 2024-11-30 | Hi Thuyphuong. Include the #. It makes the address more accurate for our forwarder.
  - 2024-11-28 | LFG! Thanks for the motivation üôè

  - 2024-05-24 | Wow ü§Ø. It‚Äôs incredible how many layers of advertising this one idea runs through.
  - 2024-12-05 | Good morning brother, is this the in-person meetup or is this over zoom?
  - 2024-04-24 | Oh good! Sorry I‚Äôm late to the party haha.
  - 2024-04-24 | Hi Lowell, I used a UPS private mailbox address as my business address. Whichever address you decide to use, customers will see it.
  - 2024-12-06 | Happy birthday <@1066465177140215928> ! Couldn‚Äôt get to where I‚Äôm at without all your help and knowledge. Hope you have the exact day that you wish for. ü•≥
  - 2024-12-04 | This is a response from my lawyers when I wanted to remove assigned search codes:

‚ÄúThere is a mechanism to delete design search codes. However, the deletion is a separate submission and a brief justification as to the request must be made under Trademark Office rules. The design search codes were selected by the Trademark Office. As reflected in the Official USPTO Notice of Design Search Code, ‚Äúassigning design search codes to your mark helps us [the USPTO] more effectively search our database for marks that may conflict with yours. Design search codes have no legal significance and will not appear on the registration certificate.‚Äù (Emphasis added.)
 
Given that the likelihood-of-confusion 2(d) search has already been conducted, the design search codes are now moot. However, if you would nonetheless like us to attempt to have them removed from the record, our quote would be $300. We ask that you provide us with the ‚Äújustification‚Äù for removing the design codes as required by the USPTO. (It seems to us that keeping the design search codes is beneficial to you, since it shows that the Examining Attorney conducted a broader, wider search when considering likelihood of confusion. But the decision of whether to proceed with their removal is yours.)‚Äù
  - 2024-12-04 | Woohoo! Congratulations! That means they‚Äôre processing your application and it‚Äôs moving towards publication.

As Han said, forward that to your ip lawyer so they can respond to the Office Action.
  - 2024-11-27 | There is a benefit of sending to more locations though, in the off chance that any one of your shipments get stuck, you have other shipments that are still in transit. Hope that helps!
  - 2024-11-27 | In my experience, shipping to 3 locations in the West was the cheapest. Choosing 1 location pays Amazon more and Forwarder less. 5 locations pays Amazon less but Forwarder more.
3 was the sweet spot.
I recommend running the numbers for all the options though to see the comparison for your product.

Also, if you‚Äôre shipping to the West, truck delivery from port to Amazon is cheaper and faster than UPS.
  - 2024-12-06 | I appreciate it, I got that call scheduled.
  - 2024-12-06 | Thank you Susan! I‚Äôm glad to be surrounded by you all that are at a higher level. Hoping I can scale up following along.
  - 2024-12-06 | Thank you Tom! 
Hello everyone! I‚Äôm glad to join the team and looking forward to helping other mentees as much as I can. ü§ó
  - 2024-10-30 | 1. Listened to 30 mins of The Power of Now
2. Paused bleeder keywords

  - 2024-11-03 | Hope it works well for you! Sponsored display didn‚Äôt work out so well for me. But the free money was worth trying haha.
  - 2024-11-03 | I have not. But I will this week to test it. Mainly just to get the credits though. I did a promo for sponsored display ads and only had to launch it for a day before receiving credits.
  - 2024-11-03 | I‚Äôve gotten about $700 in credits for ads. Definitely take advantage of those offers!
  - 2024-11-02 | That makes sense. My comparison is to the typical price that is slashed through. Cause that will drop as you sell more at a lower price.
  - 2024-11-02 | Ooh ok. So he‚Äôs just swapping between coupon and lightning deals. Very clever haha.
  - 2024-11-02 | But others will know more. That‚Äôs just from my little experience haha
  - 2024-11-02 | Yeah as long as you have more sales at the original price then the deals won‚Äôt get restricted.
  - 2024-11-02 | It‚Äôs a great idea for gaining visibility! But it can only be done for so long. As you keep selling at that lowered price Amazon will show that as your ‚Äútypical price‚Äù. It‚Äôs to prevent sellers from having fake sales lol.

  - 2024-10-23 | Ok. Thanks Susan.
  - 2024-10-23 | Will it make a difference on relaunch if I slow down my sales? Lower my PPC bids? I will still be sold out before the 2nd batch arrives.
  - 2024-10-08 | Got it! Thanks for A++ advice. üòä
  - 2024-10-08 | I am running out of budget on 2 of my campaigns, I have increased it and still running out. Do u suggest increasing still? I have 14 sales since prime day started.
  - 2024-10-07 | Ok. Like right now, with the price I am selling. I have 30% profit margjn. If I give 20% off it would be around 20% profit margin. Do you recommend increasing the price a little bit so when you do a 20% discount, the profit margin would be around 25%?
  - 2024-10-06 | When doing prime sales, how much profit margin are you guys willing to go down to?
  - 2024-09-29 | the one that looks like this?
  - 2024-09-29 | ok. thanks Engel. Do you have a link to the PPC optimization sheet?
  - 2024-09-29 | +ppc optimization sheet. Or is there a place where it is stored and we can just download it?
  - 2024-09-29 | Can I have the link to the ppc tracking sheet pls
  - 2024-11-30 | <@1225664394923348019> this vid
  - 2024-11-30 | So I saved $820 by choosing the  5 option.
  - 2024-11-30 | I asked Macy's shipping contact to give me a computatio  for the 2 and 5 warehouses. 5 warehouses was almost $500 cheaper. you don't have to pay $320 to amazon if u do 2 warehouses.
  - 2024-11-30 | Hi Hannah. Are your products ready to ship? Or you just want to get an estimate? If just an estimate, you can send any amazon warehouse address near you. If your products are ready to ship, you create shipping label via seller central. There is a video in the vault on how to create labels. When you choose 1,2,5 warehouses Amazon will send you the addresses. You don't get to choose which warehouses.
  - 2024-11-29 | When I engage with them, I always ask if we can use their vids in other platform. Some are ok, some want you to add more $$.
  - 2024-11-29 | If they give you permission, then yes you can post in other platforms. Just make sure you keep the email trail as evidence if you have not made a contract with them.
  - 2024-11-27 | Amazon has changed shipping to 1,2,5 destinations, not sure when that changed. I am just trying to figure out which option offers the best value in terms of cost  and shipping time. Thank you for your insights guys. <@536075832658231299> <@297667891992723457>
  - 2024-11-27 | ok. thank Chloe.
  - 2024-11-26 | there was a discussion in Susan's class about shipping to East coast or West coast.  What was the recommendation again? Was that you <@1168356026471436323> who said something about it? Which is cheaper? Which is much faster?
  - 2024-11-19 | Are there new shipping agents?
  - 2024-11-12 | I am in this stage now. I changed my add-ons to a totally different ones so part my unboxing videos will be edited out. If you have to choose one, do the product feature instead of unboxing. And add an unboxing video when you have your new design. Hope that helps.
  - 2024-11-08 | I hope they expand and can let people with overseas business account connect with their US account.
  - 2024-11-08 | Hi <@1066465177140215928> . I have listened to yesterday's class. You were talking about tiktok shop. I have been looking into this as well. It is very promising. Have you connected your tiktok shop to your amz accout already so it automatically does the MCF order? Also, is there a way for overseas people to open tiktok shop? There are a lot of requirements like SS, EIN and LLC, which I don't have.

  - 2024-11-27 | is that correct?
  - 2024-11-27 | yes

  - 2024-11-27 | does this mean it has been resolved?
  - 2024-11-27 | 
  - 2024-11-27 | I just acknowledged the violation then they sent me the email below
  - 2024-11-27 | that is what comes out when I click the variation
  - 2024-11-26 | this is how my listing looks like. same as yesterday. I don't know what listing they deleted as it still looks the same.
  - 2024-11-26 | and acknowledged the violation. Is there anything else I need to do?
  - 2024-11-26 | 
  - 2024-11-26 | I went to "account health"
  - 2024-11-26 | Just received this email. It says there's a duplication of the listing( Parent/Child). It also says the listing has been removed. When I check my listing, the parent/child are still there. I am not sure what to do about this.
  - 2024-11-24 | thank you so much <@536075832658231299> for your help. ‚òùÔ∏è
  - 2024-11-24 | i just had a read online. there needs to be available inventory for the variations to show on your listing. all good then.
  - 2024-11-24 | How do I make my lsiting look like this?? where it shows a ll the shoppable colors in the ad.
  - 2024-11-24 | nevermind. all good. both listings came out after a few minutes.
  - 2024-11-24 | But it show as 2 variations
  - 2024-11-24 | I submitted but only one child(brown) is under the parent
  - 2024-11-23 | I have just saved it into drafts for now
  - 2024-11-23 | I tried submitting but there was an error. What should I place on the SKU?
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-22 | I have made a new listing and sent the new FNSKU for brown variation to the supplier
  - 2024-11-22 | Will it make a new asin and not connect to the old reviews? Or it connects once parent listing is made and placed together?
  - 2024-11-22 | Ok. Will do step 1.
  - 2024-11-22 | .
  - 2024-11-22 | So this is my new add-ons for the beige and the brown color.
  - 2024-11-22 | My listing has the beige color. I want to add a brown color variation
  - 2024-11-22 | 
  - 2024-11-22 | 
  - 2024-11-21 | Can you please send me a detailed instruction or a video perhaps on how to do it? Thank u
  - 2024-11-21 | Just checked your availability. Earliest is the 26th Nov. I need to do it soon as supplier needs to place new FNSKU on the box.
  - 2024-11-21 | I could use my 1:1 call to help me go through it.
  - 2024-11-21 | Is it easy to do?
  - 2024-11-21 | Yes please. I placed a message on the active support chat as well. Not sure how it got deleted.  I have been warching youtube videos but it is so confusing and I don't want to mess it up.
  - 2024-11-21 | I have read through the old chats. I need a new one. Could someone please guide me on how to make another FNSKU. 
For my 2nd batch, I will still have the original color(beige) but I have changed the add-ons. I have added another variation, brown color, with the same add-ons as the beige. Is there a video to do that?
  - 2024-11-21 | Hi. On my next batch with color variation, do I get a new FNSKU?
  - 2024-11-17 | Hi Jamie. I have sold out for almost a month now so I don't have any data to input.

  - 2024-02-04 | I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who donated to our tutoring hall. Things have been really busy with us preparing for our classes starting in a couple of weeks. But I wanted to take a moment to say Thank you! Thank you to our donors and the Shifu's for allowing me to share my journey. I haven't met everyone but here are our donors . Thank you!!

  - 2024-02-02 | Thank you brother. They are a big part of my "why"
  - 2024-02-02 | Hi Edward. I don't live in Philippines but the charity work I do is out there.
  - 2024-01-31 | 
  - 2024-01-31 | Hi All! Today is the last day of our official fundraiser. We didn't hit our goal, but we made some good progress. And I am super appreciative of the Shifu Family. Y'all donated half of what was raised, so super thank you to you all! And thank you to the Shifu's for allowing me this platform to share. Also,  I wanted to share the winners of a drawing contest I held for January. The kids' age ranged from 6-20 that participated. Here are the 1st and 2nd place winners in each age group. 1st place won 1000pesos = $18 and 2nd place won 300pesos= $5.50. Not huge prizes in regards to U.S. dollars, but in pesos, that's significant. These prizes were personally funded by me and doesn't come out of the donated funds from the GoFundMe fundraiser. I will continue to keep the fundraiser active should anyone else like to donate in the future, but I won't be soliciting on here anymore out of respect of other charity initiatives.  https://gofund.me/bca9ef76 . Thank you all!
  - 2024-01-27 | Here's a quick update on our tutoring hall. We are installing our railing leading to the tutoring hall today. It's the last piece of the facility to be installed. Thank you to those who donated. We still are hoping to hit our $5k by next month, but if not, we will still make things happen. The kids are worth it. Thank you for letting me share.
  - 2024-01-24 | Some of the kids that will be attending our tutoring hall wanted to say Thank You to our donors and future donors. You're making a huge difference.
  - 2024-01-22 | Here's a short video of our kids starting to use the hall for a drawing contest I've created for them. They are so excited to use the room and the supplies we have. Most of their classrooms are packed with 50+ kids in a room with no Air Conditioning. Right now we can only afford fans but that's fine for now. It will get warmer during the summer. We focus primarily on kids that can't afford to go to school or struggle to keep up with their lessons. The education system there tends to push kids into the next grade even if they aren't understanding well. This is why we have 7th graders here that still struggle to read or write. And parents are encouraged to teach their kids what their teachers don't, however, they don't know how to read or write themselves. So we hope this will be a beacon of hope for the kids in our village to have a proper education so they can have a chance to prosper.
  - 2024-01-22 | Quick update. Thanks everyone who has donated so far. We raised enough funds for a printer and paper! Here's my mom with our new printer. I'm very grateful to have her help since I run all purchases through her since she's there. We will now be able to print out handouts, enrollment forms, and other learning material for the kids. Thank you!
  - 2024-01-22 | 
  - 2024-01-22 | Thank you Shifu Family for donating to the charity work we are doing in the Philippines. Thank you to Susan Hang, Linh Doan, Joan Lovelle Alfeche, Davis Truong, Michael Lee and Phuong Nguyen for donating so far! You've gotten us even closer to our goal. Our fundraiser is still going until February, so if you'd still like to contribute, please visit our GoFundMe link. We now have enough funds to buy a printer and some school supplies, so your money is already being put to great use. üôÇ . https://gofund.me/bca9ef76

  - 2024-12-04 | checking PPC and Reviews today. I also am going to work on optimizing my campaign today. My product video should be done soon so I am looking forward to adding that to my listing.
  - 2024-12-03 | I just launched a couple weeks ago and am monitoring my PPC, as well as working on FBM orders and my videographer who is completing a video for my product. Been a little disappointed with the orders I have been getting vs the PPC cost but I am trying to stay patient. Making sure my priorities are set every day before I start working.
  - 2024-11-11 | What are your top 3 goals this week for your business?
- I need to get my 5 FBM reviews on my listing
- Get my PPC Keyword Research approved by Han
- Schedule meeting with Justing and Han to go over strategy so I can launch later this week or early next week.
How long will it take?
- FBM Reviews- 1-2 days (not sure how long it will take to load onto my listing)
- PPC Keyword Research (already sent to shifu Han, need to do any adjustments afterwards. Maybe 3-4 days)
- Schedule meeting (5-6 days)
What is your due date for it?
- 6 Days (Sunday)
What support processes do you need to make that happen?
- Stay consistant every morning keeping up on developments and updates so I am not falling behind 2-3 days at a time

  - 2024-11-12 | I am trying to figure out what videos I want on my listing and am stuck between getting someone to do an unboxing or hiring someone to do an actual product video with voiceover and music. Has anyone had better success with one or the other? I am a little skeptical to spend too much because there are some changes I want to make in my next shipment including the design of the box so I will probably end up having to redue some of the listing videos. I am leaning towards doing a product review without the box in it because then I can use the video even after I update the packaging.

Has anyone had better success with one or the other? I am a little skeptical to spend too much because there are some changes I want to make in my next shipment including the design of the box so I will probably end up having to redue some of the listing videos.

  - 2024-12-04 | hi Han,
when I went to the targeting tab I got the following error message and when I exported my data from the last 2 weeks I got this document with no impressions. Have you ever seen this "removed sponser display data" note before? Do I just have to wait until amazon fixes it to export a document with real data? Thanks!
  - 2024-11-13 | nevermind, susan let me know she was the one who looked at my keyword research. Thought that was you Han. Sorry about that. Ill see you on Friday for our 1 on 1 meeting. Thanks.
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Han, I submitted my PPC keyword analysis and got the attached email back with no coaching comments. Did you or someone else get a chance to look at this? I am going to schedule a 1 on 1 meeting in your calendar. I have my 5 reviews made just waiting for them to load onto my account so I believe my listing is ready for launch besides the video I still need. Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-11-11 | I apologize. I was out of town in North Carolina for work the last 6 days and didn't have much access to discord or work on my product at all. I just sent Han my PPC Keyword research and am going to schedule a call once I get my 5 FBM review loaded onto my listing. I will try to keep up on the homework this week.

It‚Äôs called a Sundog and it forms a little rainbow on each side of the sun. Yes, rainbows can still happen in winter time!! Temperature: -15C/4F with about a foot of snow on the ground
  - 2024-11-29 | Happy Thanksgiving all you lovelies in the U.S. We have Thanksgiving here in Canada in October. No idea why there is a time difference üòÇ I hope all of you have a wonderful day and I‚Äôm proud of all of who you are becoming and what you‚Äôve done. Look at where you are and, even if you haven‚Äôt made it ‚Äúsuper successful (yet)‚Äù - look at what you‚Äôve learned! 

I‚Äôm grateful for this group and especially for all the wonderful friends and colleagues I‚Äôve met along the way ü´∂üèª
  - 2024-11-25 | Woot woot! Hopefully!!
  - 2024-11-24 | Ohhhh ok I see. Ugh! Thank goodness you got your account back in working order my dear!
  - 2024-11-24 | Love this detailed reply! Thank you Olesia!! Can you tell me what keyword(s) they didn't like from you?

Last week I messed up setting up my Black Friday coupon but I figured it out and then <@1212209797345185883> gave me really good advice as to what to set for bids for the sale. Since then, I got the most sales I've ever made in a day (which is only 6 lol), but I also have a low daily limit on my campaigns to be conservative. So I've upped those daily limits for now but will drop them back down in a few days. After having been burned too many times in paying for PPC and not making any sales, I am no longer going to just let my PPC run at high amounts. Conservative is where I'll stay üëå üòÇ 

I did hit my goals except for one which I hope to be completing this weekend which is the homework by Han. But my other goals of getting more reviews posted and finding more add-ons for my other product have been almost complete.

Any distractions or roadblocks right now are basically just having to work all the time leaving me with little time to focus on my Amazon journey. But that will change with time I'm sure. I'm not worried about it

My main whys I am doing this remain the same - to one day be  out of the 9-5 hussle of work or at least dwindle my 9-5 down to a part time job.

The stage of my journey right now is to just sell out of my current product and launch a different one. I have many different ideas of how to approach the selling of this other product, some of which are not taught here at all. I will be taking some tiny risks and trying some unique and different things to sell my new product

  - 2024-11-24 | You are so awesome <@1212209797345185883>!! But, I actually hired a fitness and nutrition coach and our plan right now is not to workout everyday. Right now we are having me train 3x a week in the gym with no cardio yet. Our goal is lose fat and only use nutrition to alter the fat loss in the beginning. Cardio will be added as needed when my body starts to adapt to the lack of calories. I did a bodybuilding competition once 3 years ago so I know and understand the process of losing fat and gaining muscle. If you follow a bodybuilding plan, you are not supposed to workout everyday as your need your muscles to rest üôÇ

Was it example 10 from our previous homework assignment that you want us to answer those questions with?

  - 2024-12-05 | But I thiiiink the customer still gets that 30 day window with this policy. I see what you‚Äôre saying though, I hope you‚Äôre right. Also, anything bought after November has a longer return policy right now. I think Mercedes had said they‚Äôve got until Jan 31st - ?
  - 2024-12-05 | Well actually, I believe it doesn‚Äôt change the return policy if I‚Äôm understanding it correctly. I believe its just saying that we don‚Äôt get paid until the parcel is delivered to the customer and they aren‚Äôt returning it

Hi guys! I just wanted to drop some information here that I just found out from Amazon about deferred payments. I noticed that Amazon is going to charge me a lot for advertising fees but I knew that I still had a bunch of orders that were waiting to go through so it wasn't making sense to me. Where are all my sales that I made from  Black Friday week? I know that I made profit and I had made more than I paid in PPC, why isn't my money there? Why is Amazon charging me for PPC and I'm not getting those sales? 

Well I looked into it more and it turns out that Amazon is now doing "deferred payments" instead of using the "Account Level Reserve". These payments are being withheld because Amazon is now waiting until the customer has received the package and it is in good working condition before they release the payment to you. So if you are waiting on payments and don't know why, this may be the cause. Here is Amazon's explanation:
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you <@1213271303327453305>!! This is such a great idea!

  - 2024-11-19 | It's been a crazy last 1-2 weeks. After getting hacked, Ihad to replace all my credit cards and change all my passwords. What a headache. On top of that I leave for Vietnam next week for 3 weeks so it's been crazy. The good news is my journey continues with this great SHIFU program, and I am working on my product bundles, branding, and sourcing with an agent in China. Get samples when I return and hopefully place my first order before the end of the year to launch in January. 

My first trip to Vietnam since 2007 so it'll be all new. I'll be in Saigon, Can Tho, Da Nang, and Phu Quoc. I have family there too but they're not tourists so if anyone here has recommendations on best places to check out, please share! Thanks fam!

  - 2024-10-05 | Don't know how to search for new products? I like to use Chatgpt! It's free and it can do your research for you. Here is a prompt I used and some lists it returned for me. It cuts your research down by a lot because you don't have to browse on Alibaba or other sites yourself. You can even ask it to look into hashtags like #amazonfinds or #tiktokmademebuyit

  - 2024-11-30 | I can choose any warehouse? How do I link the shipping/warehouse to my inventory listing? They have to follow the tracking somehow right?
  - 2024-11-30 | They are ready to ship and I need to give my supplier the shipping address
  - 2024-11-30 | Do I need to do anything with my product listing to ensure it is going to the correct warehouse?
  - 2024-11-30 | Thank you! How do you know which one to select? I was reading that you should send to 5 different ones for the best optimization? Do I randomly pick 5 or does Amazon choose for me? I was heading from other students that West side fulfillment centers are cheaper?
  - 2024-11-29 | Hello, where can you find the addresses of the Amazon warehouses to ship to? My supplier is asking where to ship it but I can't found the addresses
  - 2024-11-21 | Question, is there a general inspection checklist anywhere? Or do we make our own?
  - 2024-11-21 | The answer is yes, and I submitted the form on Alibaba lol.
  - 2024-11-21 | Do we pay taxes on our orders from china? I googled it and it says we need a resale exemption? And we‚Äôll typically need to provide Alibaba with a valid resale certificate. How do we get one?
  - 2024-11-20 | What is the typical payment for bulk orders? Do you pay everything up front? That's a relatively large payment. Or is it split 50/50 half now half when order is received? Or payment plans?

I'm watching the "How to Apply for you Brand Registry" video and it said we already covered the IP accelerator but I didn't see it. Where can I find the IP accelerator instructions? When I go there all I see is this:
  - 2024-11-11 | Does anyone have a website for their store? Or experience in making a website for their brand? What website hosting tool did you use? I used wix before but it's kind of expensive so I'm looking into other options, Hostinger seems to be good?
  - 2024-11-09 | I had this same error but I tried again after a few hours and it went away. Save your listing as a draft and come back to submit it again later and see if the error is still there
  - 2024-12-05 | And if so, how much is reasonable to pay?
  - 2024-12-05 | If we have addon items to our product and we ship the addon items to the main product factory, I have to ask my supplier to add them into all the product orders and boxes, do I have to pay them extra for this extra work?

  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Jamie, nice to meet you. I'm doing well! Trying to speed through everything. Placed a bulk order and need to finish many chat, brand registry, finding suppliers for add on products
  - 2024-11-21 | Nevermind team! I found the answer on google. Thank you
  - 2024-11-21 | 
  - 2024-11-21 | Hi team, do we pay taxes on our orders from china? I googled it and it says we need a resale exemption? And we‚Äôll typically need to provide Alibaba with a valid resale certificate. How do we get one?
  - 2024-11-19 | Do I choose one closest to me?
  - 2024-11-19 | Hello team, my supplier is asking for Amazon warehouse address but I don't know how to find that, where can I find the warehouse address?
  - 2024-10-29 | Ok I'll try again soon
  - 2024-10-21 | Does this mean I have to continue product research?
  - 2024-10-21 | Can I ask why car electronic is not allowed?
  - 2024-10-21 | Are you not able to see the product and the link from air table? It asks us to submit the product keyword and a link to the product when we submit the analysis. I assumed you knew what product it is
  - 2024-10-21 | It is car electronic
  - 2024-10-21 | What is car electric category?
  - 2024-10-21 | I'm guessing automotive/car
  - 2024-10-21 | How do I find what category it is in?
  - 2024-10-21 | Great thank you. What is the next step? Is it reaching out to suppliers? Do I start module 2?
  - 2024-10-19 | thank you for working on it so late
  - 2024-10-19 |

  - 2024-10-19 | in #3
  - 2024-10-19 | It is also included in the top seller revenue section
  - 2024-10-19 | Yes that section is asking for the review count?
  - 2024-10-19 | Please let me know if you need me to resubmit. I can add the red boxes to make it easier to see
  - 2024-10-19 | Yes, I checked again at home and it should be in there.
  - 2024-10-19 | You had the image with price, fee, and seller in the previous screenshot when you asked me to resubmit the first time
  - 2024-10-19 | I'm not at my computer right now but I can submit it again if you don't see it
  - 2024-10-19 | Can you please double check? Are you referring to product analysis 4?
  - 2024-10-19 | That's strange. I see it on my end?
  - 2024-10-17 | submitted
  - 2024-10-17 | i can resubmit online

  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you guys. So yes I checked and I have to submit one document from the manufacturer and another document to the FDA to get an accession number
  - 2024-11-14 | has anyone had this before?
  - 2024-11-14 | but if I take the word laser out of the product description page and it gets unblocked, it wouldn't make much sense to even sell this product because the main attribute is the laser.
  - 2024-11-14 | They just requested I change the details on the product description page
  - 2024-11-14 | dummy listing
  - 2024-11-14 | My listing for a laser product is currently being blocked because the Amazon system is classifying it as a class III and class IV but in reality this is Class II, which is acceptable. I submitted my appeal on the Amazon portal but they are still blocking it after review. Any thoughts on how I can get this resolved?
  - 2024-11-13 | In order to start gathering reviews for my listing, do I have to go through trademark and brand registry first?
  - 2024-11-11 | Hope this is enough for the listing to stay up. I can wait another day or two just to be safe.

  - 2024-11-11 | provided from the manufacturer.
  - 2024-11-11 | I submitted a safety data sheet
  - 2024-11-11 | I have an 1 day old active dummy listing (thanks <@1054411267340763216>) , it has been a day since I submitted my SDS/exemption sheets documents. Should I wait a couple more days to be safe that it stays active?
  - 2024-11-09 | They are about $30 each
  - 2024-11-09 | I‚Äôve been stuck with this issue for a week, it would help to get the tutorial
  - 2024-11-09 | The upc bought from nationwide or from gs1?
  - 2024-11-09 | Oh is there? Omg that would help so much
  - 2024-11-09 | From the Gs1 website, I am required to put a brand name when purchasing a barcode which is why I have encountered the error as well. There is no feature in Gs1 that allows me to buy a upc code with a generic brand name
  - 2024-11-09 | I bought one from nationwide barcode and another one from
Gs1 I tried both and while putting the generic brand name I‚Äôm having error 8572 from the attached as I listed above
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi Hannah. I will definitely try again. Did you put your your brand as generic or n/a when it went through
  - 2024-11-09 | 
  - 2024-11-09 | I put the brand name as "n/a" since that was suggested from nationwide barcodes. and it gievs me the error above, and when I select generic for the brand name, it will give me Error 8572. The error below
  - 2024-11-09 | 
  - 2024-11-09 | Hey <@1054411267340763216> Here is a screenshot of the error I am having
  - 2024-11-05 | I am figuring out the dummy listing at the moment, since the UPC code I got from GS1 is registered to a brand name, it is not allowing me to list the product as Generic Brand on Amazon. Does it make sense to buy a UPC code from elsewhere that does not have a brand name assigned to it

  - 2024-11-11 | I have an 1 day old active dummy listing (thanks <@1054411267340763216>) , it has been a day since I submitted my SDS/exemption sheets documents. Should I wait a couple more days to be safe that it stays active?
  - 2024-11-09 | They are about $30 each
  - 2024-11-09 | I‚Äôve been stuck with this issue for a week, it would help to get the tutorial
  - 2024-11-09 | The upc bought from nationwide or from gs1?
  - 2024-11-09 | Oh is there? Omg that would help so much
  - 2024-11-09 | From the Gs1 website, I am required to put a brand name when purchasing a barcode which is why I have encountered the error as well. There is no feature in Gs1 that allows me to buy a upc code with a generic brand name
  - 2024-11-09 | I bought one from nationwide barcode and another one from
Gs1 I tried both and while putting the generic brand name I‚Äôm having error 8572 from the attached as I listed above
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi Hannah. I will definitely try again. Did you put your your brand as generic or n/a when it went through
  - 2024-11-09 | 
  - 2024-11-09 | I put the brand name as "n/a" since that was suggested from nationwide barcodes. and it gievs me the error above, and when I select generic for the brand name, it will give me Error 8572. The error below
  - 2024-11-09 | 
  - 2024-11-09 | Hey <@1054411267340763216> Here is a screenshot of the error I am having
  - 2024-11-05 | I am figuring out the dummy listing at the moment, since the UPC code I got from GS1 is registered to a brand name, it is not allowing me to list the product as Generic Brand on Amazon. Does it make sense to buy a UPC code from elsewhere that does not have a brand name assigned to it
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you guys. So yes I checked and I have to submit one document from the manufacturer and another document to the FDA to get an accession number
  - 2024-11-14 | has anyone had this before?
  - 2024-11-14 | but if I take the word laser out of the product description page and it gets unblocked, it wouldn't make much sense to even sell this product because the main attribute is the laser.
  - 2024-11-14 | They just requested I change the details on the product description page
  - 2024-11-14 | dummy listing
  - 2024-11-14 | My listing for a laser product is currently being blocked because the Amazon system is classifying it as a class III and class IV but in reality this is Class II, which is acceptable. I submitted my appeal on the Amazon portal but they are still blocking it after review. Any thoughts on how I can get this resolved?
  - 2024-11-13 | In order to start gathering reviews for my listing, do I have to go through trademark and brand registry first?
  - 2024-11-11 | Hope this is enough for the listing to stay up. I can wait another day or two just to be safe.

  - 2023-12-28 | I won‚Äôt be able to make it this Sunday because I have work.
  - 2024-12-06 | Happy birthday <@1066465177140215928> !
  - 2024-10-21 | okay, thank you!
  - 2024-10-21 | Hey <@536075832658231299>, the PPC is the PPC assistant form right?
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, thank you for yalls help! Gotta head back to work
  - 2024-10-11 | I just sent a polite email stating feedback edits because he said what edits do I want from this morning. He said "people get the jest of the product from what I showed, and if i add anymore stuff it'll drop my audiences retention and views.
  - 2024-10-11 | I mean he had a list of things to highlight, because this is a paid one. He highlighted nothing and mentioned incorrect information on the video! He didn't mention one thing and says on the video "I'm not going to connect that right now because I don't have time"
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | he doesnt even have the correct stuff while talking about it
  - 2024-10-11 | yea the post is so crappy haha, we had told him what to feature and he did none put just pretty much plugged it in and turned it on. Then showed my bundles
  - 2024-10-11 | haha yeah
  - 2024-10-11 | im just so annoyed of him
  - 2024-10-11 | We also gave him the option to opt out when we had to update the software, he said he will wait.
  - 2024-10-11 | I'm going to send this to him because he's being childish and had several emails today stating how hard he has worked. And he said its been sitting in his draft box since Tuesday and just forgot to send till this morning. Lies. 

We apologize for the initial pause in production due to the software update, and we appreciate your patience in waiting for the new version to arrive. However, despite the agreed-upon deliverable dates, there have been ongoing delays. We understand that you sent the video this morning after we had already communicated our decision to part ways and requested a refund. Although you mentioned the video was recorded earlier in September, the timestamp on our product, which displays real-time, shows today's date, 10/11/24. We will accept this video and conclude our sponsorship following its submission. Thank you for your time, and we wish you the best in your future endeavors.
  - 2024-10-11 | thank you both for your inputs, ppl are shitty haha
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, yeah makes sense
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah, that's what im afraid of
  - 2024-10-11 | or have people buy and post lots of 1 review
  - 2024-10-11 | hahah
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont like him either haha, that's why i wanted to dispute but he seems childish and I dont want backlash
  - 2024-10-11 | Just wanted to see if you advice disputing or taking a loss to prevent backlash? Has this happened to you before?
  - 2024-10-11 | and he keeps emailing saying he wont refund becuase he put so much work into this
  - 2024-10-11 | I sent the request for refund to keep it cordial and he sent a crappy video this morning. He said we wont refund because he has spent hours and hours working on this. My device on the video shows a time stamped he recorded it this morning
  - 2024-10-11 | service
  - 2024-10-11 | Help! Wanted to ask for any advice on this situation Im currently experiencing. I have an influencer I'm working with, paid a deposit already. He was suppose to post a video in august and he kept delaying and not responding. He finally responded in sept when we asked to part ways and get a refund. He said his technician has been on vacation and he couldn't get the recordings done and will be able to have it done be 9/20. 9/21 came and he delayed it again. Multiple follow ups every other day and no response. Yesterday we sent another letter to part ways due to it past deadline again and he said he will send it today at noon. I still wanted to part ways bc its past my prime day and wanted it before then. He got upset and said he is not refunding something hes spent hours and hours on. He sent a video this morning and the time stamp shows he recorded it this morning and sent it to me 30 mins after he finished recording. I sent a refund request and he denied it even though the video is terrible. Would you still file a dispute on paypal or take a loss?

  - 2024-11-29 | Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Grateful for everything I've achieved this year as well as my loved ones! Also very grateful for you guys and this awesome community!
  - 2024-11-25 | I just finished my call with Justin. I want to share some tips for you guys to improve! So make sure you set up your Sellerboard if you just launched, as well as your Manychat to rack up reviews/potential reviewers! It's best to find ways to get reviews before you hit that negative review. Also try to reach your goal and exceed your own expectations as well as your customer's!
  - 2024-11-15 | I submitted my weekly homework today and I'm so happy so see the profit that I've made in just one week. It's more than what I make at my 9-5 in 2 weeks. I'm so blessed to meet everyone that I have on here as well as charity works I have done with the team. Grateful for everything ‚ù§Ô∏è ü´∂

  - 2024-12-02 | do you guys recommend opening another cc account with 0% APR a new batch of units? I still owe from my current business cc and they have started charging me interest. would it be better to open a new one while I try to pay off the one I have rn?
  - 2024-12-02 | thanks Tim!
  - 2024-12-02 | Yeah I think I'm just going to send them the missing piece in hopes they change their review üòÖ
  - 2024-12-02 | I found them in my orders by their name. There was only 1 person with that name in my orders so I am sure it is them. I am trying to send a message through Amazon and have them reach back out through the facebook page
  - 2024-12-02 | Hi everyone, I recently got a 4 star review on my product because it was missing an add on part of my product. It is because the factory made a mistake. I want to reach out to the customer to send them the missing part. Do you think that's a wise thing to do?

  - 2024-05-18 | Thank you Minh!!
  - 2024-05-16 | hey Minh! Did you find out yet? üôÇ
  - 2024-05-14 | Hi! I have a question regarding BOI. For the company applicant and beneficial owner tabs, do I file my name twice? I watched Charlie‚Äôs video but I‚Äôm a bit confused on that
  - 2024-11-26 | No I worked for it! üôÇ

  - 2024-11-26 | This weekend I got to attend/work F1 at the Paddock Club! It was such a blast and I got to meet some cool people as well ü§©üòé
  - 2024-10-30 | should I wait 2 weeks for data before lowering my price? Sales are slow
  - 2024-11-20 | For Black Friday sale, do we turn off our already enabled discount?
  - 2024-12-02 | thank you susan!
  - 2024-12-02 | so it's in the process of being transferred to another warehouse I believe
  - 2024-12-02 | oh ok so on hand is available + FC transfer
  - 2024-12-02 | ?
  - 2024-12-02 | does that mean I actually have 62 units still available
  - 2024-12-02 | which i am a bit confused about
  - 2024-12-02 | 
  - 2024-12-02 | hi guys, so i sold out for black friday. I am in the process of ordering my next batch. what is the difference between on hand and available? On hand it says I have 62 units left, but available is 0. Though Amazon has not marked it as out of stock.
  - 2024-11-26 | thanks Han
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi guys! So I have a quick question. I have my funds from my sales but I have a negative balance. It‚Äôs from charges from my ads, should I turn off my ads for now and turn it on when my funds load?
  - 2024-11-22 | It was there like 10 minutes ago
  - 2024-11-22 | I just fixed it
  - 2024-11-22 | I think it got suppressed again
  - 2024-11-22 | thank you Louis!
  - 2024-11-22 | 
  - 2024-11-22 | it keeps getting suppressed & says that I need to change my minimum price

  - 2024-11-14 | I can‚Äôt access the link ü•π
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you Jamie!
  - 2024-11-12 | No worries it wasn‚Äôt your fault! I think it was Amazon removing ‚Äúviolated‚Äù posts ü•π
  - 2024-11-12 | I have no clue why it was removed ü•≤
  - 2024-11-12 | It was Louis and Khoa
  - 2024-11-09 | was there any violations in these reviews?
  - 2024-11-09 | with videos
  - 2024-11-09 | 2. Tagline: Great product great price. = I went camping with one of my friends and they had one similar to this one. After receiving this product, I can tell that it is much higher quality and I love it so much already. I tried all the features and function and it was great. Definitely 10/10!!!
  - 2024-11-09 | 1. Tagline: Perfect for Security and Peace of Mind = Working the graveyard shift as a security guard, I bought these to use at night. I've tried other brands, but Virtual Haven's goggles are by far the best. The images are sharp, and the IR illuminator works flawlessly even in complete darkness. These goggles are well-built and rugged, which is a huge plus since I often work in harsh weather conditions. The battery life is excellent, lasting through my entire shift.
  - 2024-11-09 | Can you guys help me review my reviews and why were they taken down?
  - 2024-11-09 | thanks han!
  - 2024-11-07 | please let me know if I'm doing them correctly

  - 2024-10-25 | i tried just the 725-210-7249 but it wont let me either
  - 2024-10-25 | Hi <@536075832658231299> it wont let me schedule a meeting wd u. the phone number Im trying to key in says invalid but this is the number Im using. 

Phone no: 725-210-7249.
  - 2024-10-16 | I'm just really afraid that if we change anything in the listing may mess up what we currently have and will have to go through the review process again... but pls let me know if u think otherwise. thank u
  - 2024-10-16 | Is the deep link mandatory? since we're not hiring freelancers to do the reviews. But instead, we'll have maybe 2 or 3 of our staff make the purchase and then reimbursed and will do the reviews
  - 2024-10-16 | 
  - 2024-10-16 | my concern is that if I do that, I'm afraid it'll mess up the previous data we have for the listing and may lead to another listing review.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hello <@1066465177140215928> I tried changing the product title but it won't give me the option to just change the title b/c it prompts us to update the whole listing.
  - 2024-10-16 | Thanks Han. I was trying to create a deeplink using this link which incl our ASIN but not getting any results  -- https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thermal+label+printer&hidden-keywords=[B0D937HW3R]&ref=nb_sb_noss_1
  - 2024-10-15 | Good morning @everyonecould I get your thoughts on the above please? Thank u
  - 2024-10-14 | My IP address is already registered with our Seller Central account. Im just afraid that it will create an issue or red flag if I create a deeplink using the same device, considering that I am located in the Philippines and not in the US?
  - 2024-10-14 | Q2: re: the creation of deeplink. 

the instructions said that it was meant for a freelancer through Upwork... Is it okay to create deeplink acct using the same device, IP address and email we use for our Seller acct,
  - 2024-10-14 | and so I was wondering if its possible or better if I just copy the listing and then add another condition then set up fbm
  - 2024-10-14 | Hello @everyone, could I pls get ur thoughts on this-- I notice that whenever we click on add another condition and set up an fbm... the listing changes from fba to fbm

  - 2024-12-04 | Hi Sovatha, 1 UPC for each Variation (SKU)
  - 2024-11-22 | You will. There will be a parent listing and your variations will be the child
  - 2024-11-22 | There are some requirements in terms of what is needed to be filled out based on the product category that you're in.
  - 2024-11-22 | <@1167106129415909496> - Hi Trish. It's been awhile since I created variations, but you can start by going to your "Inventory > Manage All Inventory" in Seller Central.  

From there, click on "Add a Variation" located at the top right.  Follow the instructions in the Variation Wizard.
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi <@691122008930648136> . No need to click on the refund button. Amazon will automatically refund customers when they initiate a return.  The returned item will follow your return process you have setup in your business settings.

  - 2024-12-03 | Hi everyone. Hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving. Like <@1066465177140215928> , Monday was the best day for me as well. I only participated in Cyber Monday (3 Days) and not the entire BF/Cyber Monday.  Since BF/CM was 11 Days long...my strategy has shifted as I wanted to ensure I don't sell out of inventory and focus on profitability this time around.
  - 2024-03-05 | Hi everyone. When filing for a trademark, would you suggest paying for their service to search USPTO records? I did a high level search and it looks like there are no conflicts. However, just wanted to ensure it doesn't get denied and cause further delay.
  - 2024-12-06 | My kids did all the üéÑdecorations!
  - 2024-11-29 | Hi Hannah. The address and options to ship to will be provided to you once you start your shipping plan. You can get that started now and coordinate with your supplier if you're ready.
  - 2024-11-12 | That's correct. When you're planning your shipment, you would coordinate the locations with your freight forwarder. They'll let you know the price for the locations you selected. Once you both agree to the locations to be shipped to, you can finalize the shipment plan on Amazon.
  - 2024-11-12 | Hi Sovatha. That's correct. The maximum weight for an Amazon FBA box is 50 lbs, unless the box contains a single oversized item that weighs more than 50 lbs,which I don't think applies to most of us here.  

You can ship to 1, 3, or 5 locations. The assumption is that if you ship to multiple Amazon warehouses, the quicker your inventory will be available. However, I would check the amazon location with your freight forwarder to see which option is the most cost effective and makes the most sense for you. Most students here ship to 3 or 1 location.

  - 2024-11-22 | that should be fine, i usually set it a dollar or so lower to avoid it from getting supressed.. once schedule.. you'll see the Discounted Prime Price
  - 2024-11-12 | Jennifer,that's odd. I checked my other reviews and it's up. I can try to submit again.
  - 2024-11-19 | The Delivery Window is based on it arriving to amazon warehouse..not the port.
  - 2024-11-19 | Hi <@1256245998255345695>. In your situation, it looks like 1 shipment might not arrive within the window you set for tomorrow. Worst case is they'll give you an alert/notification for you to acknowledge. Just be sure to monitor with your freight forwarder to prevent it from occurring too often.

You have the ability to always update your arrival window, ONLY if the date you set didn't pass. Therefore, since your freight forwarder didn't give you a tracking number, you should connect with them for updates to adjust your window accordingly.
  - 2024-11-14 | Yes. That's it
  - 2024-11-14 | You should see it there
  - 2024-11-14 | It's in your shipping queue
  - 2024-11-13 | then update your shipment window to ensure it arrives within that window
  - 2024-11-13 | ahh got it... you should be good. I would check with your freight forwarder once in a while to get an idea of where your inventory is at and when its scheduled to arrive at Port and ETA on when it will arrive to amazon warehouse...
  - 2024-11-13 | the shipment ID/reference ID is something they usually collect from us... did they notice your tracking number and just mentioned that it was wrong?
  - 2024-11-13 | as long as your inventory arrives within the window you set, you are totally fine
  - 2024-11-13 | however, in your case,  they didnt provide you one..so the method i provided you is the work around
  - 2024-11-13 | Amazon requires us to input a tracking number...
  - 2024-11-13 | If they are not providing you with a trackable Tracking number, it doesn't affect them at all
  - 2024-11-13 | the tracking number wasn't something they provided you correct?
  - 2024-11-13 | yea.. usually i supply the reference ID
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Kazoua! Your freight forwarder told you your shipping # is wrong?  Can you gather more info on what they are asking for? Could they possibly be asking for info from you (shipment id, reference id)?

If it's regarding Tracking #, you can always update that.
  - 2024-10-30 | however, if your freight forwarder doesn't have a valid tracking for you, please select "Others" ..amazon system will not check against anything..and your random character/numbers will be accepted
  - 2024-10-30 | If you selected a specific carrier, it will check against what you have selected..
  - 2024-10-30 | 
  - 2024-10-30 | Hi <@1256245998255345695> - Can you change your "Carrier" to "Others" and try again?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Hannah, during my sourcing phase, I had suppliers willing to do it without any cost as long as we handled the logistics and ship the add-on items to them. As Jamie mentioned, it'll depend on your negotiation and how accommodating your supplier is.
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi. Yes. I think I can get that started and completed sometime next week if they is ok. Kids are off all this week.
  - 2024-11-15 | Got it. I have added a "priority" column and will set it accordingly
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi All. Hope everyone is doing well! I apologize for the delay. My kids been sick since halloween and I didn't have much free time. However, they are all better now so I'm getting back into things. Thanks for your understanding.

  - 2024-10-30 | Ok I take that back, revert back
  - 2024-10-30 | My OCD level just went through the roof...unread .....
  - 2024-10-30 | Omg...maybe I shouldn't have asked about the private channels
  - 2024-10-30 | Lol build a script to automate it..jk
  - 2024-10-30 | I don't have visibility to the private channels with each members, not sure how active he is in those channels
  - 2024-10-30 | No problem. Yea, I help him here and there, but he seems very quiet so I encouraged him to reach out more if he needs help/guidance. If anyone connects with me and raises any concerns, I'll give y'all a heads up.
  - 2024-10-30 | Just wanted to give you all a heads up in case he needs help, we can prioritize
  - 2024-10-30 | I think he'll be ok
  - 2024-10-30 | I think he is the type that is a little quiet and doesn't ask for help when needed. So I encourage him to reach out and be more active.
  - 2024-10-30 | Hi All. Had a conversation with Lowell this morning as he asked me about a customer complaint and he shared a little bit about his challenges. I wanted to share with you all so we're all aware of his emotional state, in case he needs additional support from the team.

Name: Lowell Gimena
Status: Launched

Current Challenges:

- High ACOS / Low Profit
- Customer Filed Complaint (I assisted him with this)
- Supplier delays
- Feels unsupported

Current Resolution / Actions: I encouraged him to focus on what he can do when challenges¬†come up as this journey is truly an emotional rollercoaster.¬†

We identified that he needs to reach out and ask for help as it's one of the personal challenges he hasn't taken. I also directed him to the post launch meeting that you all are offering!  He mentioned he already reached out to Justin and I believe he got assistance. 

He also said that before he launched, he used up his 1 call. So he felt as though he can't get anymore assistance.
  - 2024-10-30 | We started together as she was in my class.. so im super happy for her successful launch
  - 2024-10-30 | No worries! Happy she's doing well and glad you all helped her as well!
  - 2024-10-29 | Got it. Thanks

  - 2024-10-28 | Hi Tom. Yes. I have Loom and used it in the previous recording. I can create a video and share.
  - 2024-10-23 | Done

  - 2024-11-18 | Awesome. Thank you! What about for FBM reviews. Did you ship any of your product FBM to friends and family or reviewers for reviews?
  - 2024-11-18 | Hello everyone - when bulk order is ready for shipping, how many do you recommend shipping to your home for FBM?
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok! you should have it in your inbox in about 10 minutes
  - 2024-11-15 | Should I dM you this info or email?
  - 2024-11-15 | Yes I paid them. Everything is in motion with trademark. I applied for my brand regsitry and was declined. Do you think it was because one of my storefront was deactivated at that time? And I have to wait for brand approval before I create the listing and get the FNSKU for my product, is that correct?
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Minh. From what I understand the application takes up to 18 months for full approval. The Attorney didn't see any challenges with our trademark and have submitted the application for trademark. Attorney said to wait 10 days to apply for brand in which I did. I think at the time I applied for the brand, my canada store was deactivated due to no activity. Canada is now ative again and I submitted an appeal 2 days ago.
  - 2024-11-15 | Hello - Question about brand registry and when to create the listing to obtain the FNSKU. Are we supposed to wait for brand approval before creating the listing? I thought we were supposed to wait - but I went back to module 2 and in part 3 it said we need to take photos of our package with the FNSKU already on there and include it with the brand application. Please advise. Just started production and hopefully I can get this squared away soon.ü´§

  - 2024-12-06 | Please remind me what I should put for the dangerous goods tab when I have batteries included üôè
  - 2024-12-06 | Ahhh ok thank you!
  - 2024-12-06 | And because it contains batteries, what should I put under dangerous goods tab?
  - 2024-12-06 | and then change it later to FBA?
  - 2024-12-06 | sorry I meant merchant fulfill
  - 2024-12-06 | On the listing creation - fulfillment type - do I put FBA initially to be able to send products to friends and for paid reviews?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Minh, Just schedule for Satruday at 4pm because it was available. If you need to change it, just let me know!
  - 2024-12-05 | Thank you! Should I delete the dummy listing now or leave it alone?
  - 2024-12-05 | I can just do a quick product listing creation to get the FNSKU and then go back and fine tune and make it better, is that correct?
  - 2024-12-05 | <@1059659092475531444> Can you please confirm if there's anything special I need to do to create the new listing under my brand? Or will it automatically go under the brand once the brand is approved and all I have to do is click on "Add product" at the top left corrner?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Jamie. Thanks for checking in. I'm doing well. Juggling work and new baby and fam. My brand was just approved and I'm working on creating listing for the FNSKU to send to suppllier. My product is ready to ship. Feeling a bit overwhelmed since I'm reaching unknown territory right now.
  - 2024-10-28 | Hello! To get the FNKSU barcode, should I create the code using the sample listing I created before? Or create a new listing of the actual product I am selling then create the FNSKU?
  - 2024-10-23 | Can you please remind me I have one free session with Justin to go over the product selected, is that correct? Should I scheudle the call with him now? We are about to design packaing for this product and place bulk order when completed.
  - 2024-10-23 | Sorry their description wasn't clear. They said we don;t need packaging details until 8-12 months after application has been submitted.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is this the order I should be taking? Or do I need to go ahead and place the bulk order now to get the photos?
  - 2024-10-16 | I was waiting for the trademark to get approved first before I design the packaging to be send to the supplier and then order the builk order.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hi! I;m a little confused and just about to start the tradmark process. One of the attorneys list of itmes needed is a photo of our logo on the package. I thought this wasn't needed until we start the brand registry.

  - 2024-10-22 | Great! I‚Äôve requested you as a friend. Let‚Äôs DM each other now.
  - 2024-10-22 | Welcome <@1031622651468333076>! Happy to be your accountability partner as you get started on your Amazon FBA journey!
  - 2024-10-10 | Yes finally! Thank you Minh for reviewing!
  - 2024-10-05 | Thanks for the tip!
  - 2024-10-02 | I unfortunately can‚Äôt join PR classes due to my baby‚Äôs bedtime but will watch the videos and submit 4 more product analysis tomorrow morning.
  - 2024-10-01 | thank you I see it! Will review,
  - 2024-10-01 | Thanks Minh. I will share that today along with another product that is relatively new in the market. Did you review the 3 products I submitted to the Product Support Request form on Friday?
  - 2024-09-30 | <@1054411267340763216> Question: If the product is a new market (only $500K-$600K total revenue) and doesn't have any seller making above $100K, is it still a good product to go after? All sellers are new sellers with 100 reviews or less. Or should I keep this product on a watchlist and see how it grows over time? Top sellers are making $18K, $44K, and $47K.
  - 2024-10-10 | My progress didn't transfer to the new course

  - 2024-11-06 | Now that the elections are over, I am wondering how our Amazon FBA businesses would be affected when it comes to tariffs and imports from China. Does that mean our products and production costs would be higher?

  - 2024-10-20 | nvm I think it checked data on page 2 or something which is why it was low revenue?
  - 2024-10-20 | I just checked my product's market again today and total revenue went down to $50K. Is this something to be concerned if my product is not potential anymore?
  - 2024-10-17 | When ordering samples, it‚Äôs just to sample the product? No logo or custom box needed?
  - 2024-10-17 | I have one supplier that would only do custom box for 1000 MOQ. How important is it to have a custom box for launch?
  - 2024-10-16 | Okay thank you for your response <@1054411267340763216> and <@1066465177140215928>. I am able to negotiate down to 300 MOQ with black or gray color instead.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is it worth settling for a high MOQ of 1000 if I want to do a customized color for my product? Currently in the market, there are many black or gray colors. I noticed that the top selling competitor's product is a silver color.
  - 2024-10-14 | Did this happen because of the battery? Do I need to apply for that GTIN exemption?
  - 2024-10-14 | So should I already have found a supplier before making a dummy listing? Han said that the dummy listing doesn't need to be 100% correct so I haven't found a supplier yet.
  - 2024-10-14 | So my product has a battery, I'm not sure what type of battery and I tried to look at my competitor's listing to see if they list it but cannot find it. How should I fill out the battery questions?
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1054411267340763216> Just checking to see when you will share my product analysis for 15 and 16?
  - 2024-10-10 | ok thank you Han for answering!
  - 2024-10-10 | So I started Module 2 - Do I find a supplier first before creating a dummy listing? Minh said in the dummy listing video that I would need to get the product details like model number, etc. from the supplier.
  - 2024-10-10 | Hi <@536075832658231299>! I've completed intro module and module 1. Starting on Module 2 today.
  - 2024-11-01 | DONE <@1031622651468333076>
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi <@613172337470341150> fellow ENFP! Are you post-launch stage? Would love another accountability partner that is a stage ahead of me so that I can learn from your experience.
  - 2024-10-22 | <@1031622651468333076> Happy to be your accountability partner as your start your Amazon FBA journey!

Below is some important key points that will give you a higher chance to succeed in this journey.

1. Commiment: I know you guys have your life duties, but please commit to this journey and stay focus for the next 6 months.

2. Accountability: Keep yourself accountable, stay dedicated and put in the work required. Find an accountability partner will help as well. Remember, you're not in it alone, reach out for help when you face challenges.

3. Mindset: I wanna emphasize this is not an easy path. You willl for sure face a lot of challenges, roadblocks, and setbacks. But as long as you keep moving forward and don't quit, you'll find your way to success. Join Monday class with Shifu Charlie will help strengthening your mindset.

4. Stay Coachable: We can't teach people who don't have an open mind to learn new things. Once you get all the basic knowledge down, you can learn on your own all you want. But at first, listen to what we teach. My goal is to make you guys become more successful than me, so rest assure that I'll teach you everything I know as long as you listen.

---Thank you and let's get sh** done--

  - 2024-07-29 | Our friend finally reunited with her mother after 10 long years, but their time together was tragically cut short after only 9 months when her mom passed away unexpectedly last Thursday.
This sudden loss has left them unprepared both emotionally and financially as they were just newly college graduates and still have student loan debts.
Please join us in sending prayers and support to help her navigate this difficult time. Any prayer or contribution is genuinely appreciated.

  - 2024-11-06 | Hello @everyone 
Class today we will discuss PPC Practice 3.
Then we will talk about other ppc campaigns (overview)
  - 2024-12-04 | I'm ok guys just little headache let's hop on the call
  - 2024-12-04 | We can also discuss chinese new year time as well
  - 2024-12-04 | Hey guys, feel a bit under the weather today. I won't have a material to share but will be on call to answer questions and optimize your ppc or expose some of ppc-assistant logic if you care to know
  - 2024-11-07 | Check <#1199034625696219227>
  - 2024-11-08 | @everyone Quick announcement.
When you create your official listing (with brand name). Make sure you put in the correct title that you plan to use in the future, we have seen restriction with changing the title recently.
There are ways to update your title but it's a hassle and could waste your time so just be right at the beginning.
  - 2024-10-14 | ah I'm an idiot ok
  - 2024-10-14 | nah we don't count the LLC. So South America?
  - 2024-10-10 | yes every order goes through amazon so fbm should be on there
  - 2024-04-25 | Store name/brand name can be completely different than your business name
  - 2024-03-05 | Not really it's quite expensive. You can search on uspto website or pay a fiverr service for cheaper
  - 2024-01-30 | How to file EIN# for FREE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXQcW1dHE9w
  - 2024-01-30 | IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è : If you receive anything like the picture below in your mailbox after paying the TRADEMARK LAWYER online with IP ACCELERATOR. 
DO NOT PAY again, it's a SCAM!
  - 2024-01-30 | Dear Shifu family, @everyone 
It has been reported that some individuals are attempting to leverage the Amazon portal to solicit free products from sellers, in exchange for reviews. Please be aware that this practice is against Amazon's policy and could result in serious consequences for both parties involved, including account suspension.
‚ö†Ô∏è As a reminder, it's crucial that no mention of reviews, whether related to a request, an offer, or a negotiation, should be made through the Amazon portal. This includes all forms of communication - messages, customer support discussions, or any other interaction facilitated by Amazon.
  - 2024-01-30 | This is a new requirement under the transparency act. https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/boir/html .Who has a business entity needs to file this.

  - 2024-12-05 | 
  - 2024-12-04 | you can forward that to your ip lawyer
  - 2024-12-03 | let's aim to do this every month, you can input your last month data for now
  - 2024-12-02 | Hi @everyone launch members, please give me quick update on your store performance by filling this form here
https://airtable.com/appQIY56vYDVvdBkf/shraPE1hZTFeQ8gE3
  - 2024-11-22 | Isn't this the whole point of Data visibility?
  - 2024-10-21 | @everyone is ppc homework too difficult this week? Not many people submitted.
  - 2024-10-08 | We'll touch base on this
  - 2024-10-08 | I already monitor your launch bids they are good
  - 2024-10-07 | It's too late to increase price maybe next time, if you want to increase price do that 2 months before prime. 
But again, why do you have to do all that for just 2 days?
  - 2024-10-07 | The minimum discount for prime is 20% so depends on your margin you can decide to keep it 20% or give a but more
  - 2024-10-04 | just use your regular campaigns, don't need to change everything for just 2 days
  - 2024-10-04 | it does, you give amazon more money basically
  - 2024-09-29 | That's too high there must be something wrong
  - 2024-09-28 | I you do it, make sure you'll be profitable right at the beginning.
  - 2024-09-28 | But if I have to choose 1 to test it out, I'll go with page visits.
  - 2024-09-28 | well it entirely depends on your goal and your product performance.
And clearly it is not for new seller.
It's more for when you trying to grow your brand. As these campaigns won't give you product ranking
  - 2024-09-28 | these are Sponsored Brand campaigns
  - 2024-10-26 | @everyone please read this

https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/booking/sZzWsC5MEcbtRRfgawqU?user_id=tvtAHbbVDvky72E3b3rr
  - 2024-11-28 | Yeah let's do that
  - 2024-11-28 | I think you need to add color name for the one below
  - 2024-11-28 | check on amazon.com
  - 2024-11-28 | are the listings still connected of being separated?
  - 2024-11-27 | Just make a new one and combine the 2 children again this time make sure the new parent has correct info
  - 2024-11-27 | Are u trying to change the old parent?
  - 2024-11-27 | Is that the old one that got the violation?
  - 2024-11-27 | Make sure to do it right next time
  - 2024-11-27 | You just need to keep creating the new parent
  - 2024-11-27 | It's still stuck in there but it's separated on the amazon site
  - 2024-11-27 | Yes
  - 2024-11-26 | You can try again but let's hop on a call with an amazon rep to have them look over and verify it first be fore conbining
  - 2024-11-26 | Make sure the parent matches the attribute of those 2 asins
  - 2024-11-26 | Read the bullets they give you
  - 2024-11-26 | It says removed mean they're been separated
  - 2024-11-24 | Sure no worries üëåüèª
  - 2024-11-23 | Then fill out the info required in red you should see them combined after that
  - 2024-11-23 | The goal is to combine the asins together
  - 2024-11-23 | It will create 2 extra skus for the 2 asins but you don't need to sell under those 2 new skus
  - 2024-11-23 | Use  different SKUs
  - 2024-11-23 | We just need to add the items in that bucket now
  - 2024-11-23 | The parent lising is the bucket that's all it does
  - 2024-11-23 | Think of it this way: you have 2 items that needed to be in the same bucket
  - 2024-11-23 | Note: you must keep title, bullets and everything from all listings to be the same to prevent they getting splitted later
  - 2024-11-23 | Then send me screenshot of that tab
  - 2024-11-23 | Toggle it on and go to variation tab
  - 2024-11-23 | You should see a button say "does this product have variation"
  - 2024-11-23 | Now create a new one and send me screenshot at the creation stage
  - 2024-11-23 | Okay cool
  - 2024-11-22 | They will combine all the reviews together
  - 2024-11-22 | Meet me for step 2
  - 2024-11-22 | You can create shipment and send supplier fnsku when step 1 is done no need to wait until they are connected
  - 2024-11-22 | Step 1: create an entire new listing for the new color
Step 2: create a placeholder listing (parent) (turn on the variation button) and connect the listing in step 1 and the old one together
  - 2024-11-22 | Ok
  - 2024-11-22 | Send me some screenshots
  - 2024-11-22 | Second what do you have on your inventory rn

  - 2024-10-28 | did you put cogs on sellerboard?

  - 2024-10-25 | if it's active then you're good, and yes close the listing
  - 2024-10-25 | the warning is to tell you to update some missing information, just go to edit and put the info in
  - 2024-10-25 | but that should be easy
  - 2024-10-25 | you may need to reupload images and bullets etc.

  - 2024-10-14 | Another option is to open every 3 weeks and close the day after regardless of sell or not
  - 2024-10-14 | Just withdraw those 2 to your house if you leave in the state. If not open to sell it otherwise it can't stay in stranded for more than 30 days
  - 2024-10-11 | so it can wait after the meeting

  - 2024-11-10 | Can you send the analysis sheet for this one?
  - 2024-11-09 | ik it's a bit discouraging but I rather let you go slow than pursue something that is not worth the effort with high risk of failure
  - 2024-11-09 | we can make exception if the market is super potential which is rare
  - 2024-11-09 | yeah usually fragile products are no-gos for beginners
  - 2024-10-12 | <@1054411267340763216> Please send Alice the google calendar here
  - 2024-10-10 | <@1292032925964959755> here's your private message channel
  - 2024-12-04 | or just hire a highschooler or sth
  - 2024-12-04 | I hire a guy myself usually pay per hour, you can contact some 3Pl around your area
  - 2024-11-26 | Or give them access to your discord account to ask in here
  - 2024-11-26 | Hmm i'd say have someone at home monitor it for you. Come up with a check list and what to do in case soemthing happen
  - 2024-11-25 | That is correct
  - 2024-11-25 | If yes u can turn off the old one if you want
  - 2024-11-25 | Did you link the new link to qrcode?
  - 2024-11-25 | Duplicate the automation flow into a new one
  - 2024-11-25 | Can you duplicate the flow and change the link to the qrcode?

  - 2024-11-22 | I fix the form
  - 2024-11-21 | Just put those in other
Every product is different so I don't think there's a problem tho. Amazon sometimes give discount on referrl fee that's why some people don't have it but it doesn't mean they won't have it forever
  - 2024-11-11 | can you unpublish and republish again
  - 2024-11-11 | hmm your logic looks correct
  - 2024-11-11 | you may wanna chekc the condition there

  - 2024-10-17 | 1000 is a bit too much stay under 500. If neccessary you can skip box design first batch
  - 2024-10-14 | Composition: Lithium Ion
Regulation: Not applicable
  - 2024-10-14 | apply for GTIN exemption
  - 2024-10-10 | You can do it now no need waiting for supplier
  - 2024-10-10 | The goal is to see is there any requirements for that product
  - 2024-10-10 | And model number is basically what you decide it to be so it doesn't really matter
  - 2024-10-10 | Dummy listing doesn't need to be correct 100%
  - 2024-10-10 | done
  - 2024-12-04 | change the original if needed
  - 2024-12-04 | ehh no it has to be exactly the same
  - 2024-12-04 | and other info as well
  - 2024-12-04 | but the text should be the same
  - 2024-12-04 | picture can be different
  - 2024-12-04 | then we can combine it with the original
  - 2024-12-04 | after you have that make sure it doesn't have any restriction
  - 2024-12-04 | with new UPC
  - 2024-12-04 | yes
  - 2024-12-04 | it should be almost exactly the same as the original (title, desc, keywords, etc)
  - 2024-12-04 | now create an entire new listing for the second variation
  - 2024-12-04 | ok keep that original one
  - 2024-12-04 | the original one
  - 2024-12-04 | is your main listing still up?
  - 2024-12-04 | ok let's do it again
  - 2024-12-04 | uh oh
  - 2024-12-04 | how did you create the variation
  - 2024-12-04 | let's ignore that amazon support part
  - 2024-12-04 | did you create a new listing then combine them?
  - 2024-12-04 | how did you do this part?
  - 2024-12-04 | download that form first
  - 2024-12-04 | if you can send some screenshots here I can help over text

  - 2024-11-30 | You can see download tab in there too
  - 2024-11-30 | Or go to Catalog > upload via file
  - 2024-11-30 | Follow that link they send you should see a Download tab
  - 2024-11-30 | Just download the form and see what's in it you can send some screenshots here we can schedule a call if needed to look over it tgt
  - 2024-11-30 | but it shouldn't be that hard
  - 2024-11-30 | download that file and see what's in it I never created variations via file before
  - 2024-11-30 | looks like they want you to submit via a file
  - 2024-11-11 | Well nothing wrong with negotiating for better price
  - 2024-11-11 | You have to keep up with returns if doing fbm
  - 2024-11-11 | And the volume is low so you can defo do that on your own
  - 2024-11-11 | I think for now you can try some fbm to get farmiliar with it before using a 3PL
  - 2024-11-07 | Also give that new one some time start slowly
  - 2024-11-07 | Slow it down focus on the one that works
  - 2024-11-05 | Hmm I thought you do pretty good? Are you tryna scale?
  - 2024-11-13 | You can update tracking# yes
  - 2024-10-29 | this doesn't look like tracking ID but FBA ID
  - 2024-10-15 | usually Macy gives the best price
  - 2024-10-15 | that's probably not the final number just an estimate amount
  - 2024-10-14 | that looks correct
  - 2024-10-10 | should be ok, it's about the pace. Make it seems realistic

  - 2024-11-18 | if you have more than 5 you can do another submission
  - 2024-11-18 | I leave 5 sections for you
  - 2024-11-18 | Thy, the sheets look good but can you submit 1 sheet per section?

  - 2024-11-18 | the columns should look something like this
  - 2024-11-18 | 
  - 2024-11-18 | if you have multiple files just upload multiple files
  - 2024-11-18 | the tool needs to look at what is exactly generated originally from Amazon to understand
  - 2024-11-18 | the column Keyword has "- exact" for example
  - 2024-11-18 | I saw you combine multiple files into one?
  - 2024-11-17 | <@1212159958976827482> just got your ppc assistant request, please submit again don't change anything on the downloaded files, submit the files as they are

  - 2024-11-20 | yeah let's add the rest in
  - 2024-10-29 | your margin is already super low right now, I don't think dropping price is a good option
  - 2024-10-29 | result sent
  - 2024-10-29 | we can try to boost ppc but it may be very expensive
  - 2024-10-28 | I'm not mentioning anything about generating keywords
  - 2024-10-28 | go to the targeting tab on the campaign(where you see all the keywords) to download the csv
  - 2024-10-28 | no the sheet you used to submit the second form was wrong
  - 2024-10-25 | you have to go to where the keywords are to export
  - 2024-10-25 | for ppc assistant
  - 2024-10-25 | <@809813064756887582> the sheet in the second form you uploaded is not correct

  - 2024-10-15 | But well you can use the one Susan sent
  - 2024-10-15 | You have to duplicate it
  - 2024-10-15 | It'll be different for everyone instead use ppc tracker along with pppc assistant and practice with ppc homework
  - 2024-10-15 | And you don't need that sheet in the video there it's just to demonstrate the idea don't apply the formula
  - 2024-10-15 | It's not that one, find the ppc tracker video

  - 2024-10-13 | nah not really
  - 2024-10-13 | yeah go to exact campaign under campaign setting you can switch it to fixed bid

  - 2024-10-28 | but you can consult with Justin on this to see what's his opinion is
  - 2024-10-28 | Since it's your first product, I'm leaning toward the later. Take a bit more time to find a better market with less restriction while building up your experience with Amazon
  - 2024-10-28 | on the other hand, staying away from this market can save you a lot of headache later down the road
  - 2024-10-28 | It's a bit hard to give the right answer in this case, as moving forward with that supplier inherit some risk, but of course it'll continue your progress with less disruption

  - 2024-11-09 | if you not sure what target ACOS to give to the assistant just post your ppc tracker here I can give suggestion
  - 2024-11-09 | to make it easier, bring it back up to where it was before, every 2 weeks do ppc tracker and use ppc assistant
  - 2024-11-09 | which explains why your sale is sinking
  - 2024-11-09 | you can monitor every but don't adjust it too often or your listing will slowly die
  - 2024-11-09 | even couple days still over optimizing
  - 2024-11-09 | instagram: use meta business and schedule posts. You can spend a day to schedule 30 posts a month
  - 2024-11-09 | fbm reviews: not that hard just write a bunch of reviews in advance
  - 2024-11-09 | ppc you only optimize once every 2 weeks, don't tell me you optimize everyday?
  - 2024-11-08 | give me 3 things that take up the most of your time (from Amazon)
  - 2024-11-08 | other than that just monitor your account 15min a day, you don't need a VA now
  - 2024-11-08 | well, you can keep things minimal with ppc assistant once every 2 weeks

  - 2024-12-05 | The purpose of shopable videos is not only lie on your listing, it can change from time to time but the real benefit is the more you have the more exposure you get since they're showed on other listings. So if you can bump more out then go for it
  - 2024-11-03 | @everyone don't forget to setup your BF sale. It's similar to how to set Prime Day
  - 2024-11-25 | hey Lowell any update?
  - 2024-10-30 | for ppc optimization, 
1. Look at ppc homework 1 and do about 20-50 keywords
2. Compare with the result
3. If you don't get most of it right -> use ppc assistant as your optimization tool while you're practice more
  - 2024-10-30 | also, navigate to homeowork and do Data visibility homework and send that to me as well
  - 2024-10-30 | can you watch ppc tracker and fill that out and send it to me?
  - 2024-10-30 | What's high ACOS? 100%?
  - 2024-10-30 | Have you been doing homework? and use our trackers/tools?
  - 2024-10-30 | Hey <@1213522117304520774>, it's been a few weeks since launch, just checking in to see how you doing?
  - 2024-11-20 | Next time it'll work
  - 2024-11-20 | That's what I was suspecting
  - 2024-11-20 | Did you wait?
  - 2024-11-15 | Delete and wait mean you removing it from Amazon catalog
  - 2024-11-15 | No download the one say: Add the one NOT in Amazon catalog
  - 2024-11-15 | Make sure to use microsoft excel
  - 2024-11-15 | When you choose the product type it should show the red boxes
  - 2024-11-15 | All red ones are needed
  - 2024-11-15 | let's delete and do it again this time send me screenshot of the sheet first before uploading
  - 2024-11-15 | also did you mark Update under Update/Delete column?
  - 2024-11-15 | don't fill the whole thing
  - 2024-11-15 | just fill out the red outlined ones
  - 2024-11-15 | usually we don't need to fill out the inventory part
  - 2024-11-13 | and upload the file
  - 2024-11-13 | wait at least 24 hours
  - 2024-11-13 | then delete it
  - 2024-11-13 | then take some screenshot from the listing jsut in case
  - 2024-11-13 | it's safe to download and fill out the sheet first make sure everything correct
  - 2024-11-13 | ok then back to the deleting and reuploading method
  - 2024-11-13 | that's why I'm asking do you have to use that one
  - 2024-11-13 | then you must use the same ASIN then
  - 2024-11-13 | if it's still the same ASIN then it's not gonna work
  - 2024-11-13 | you can tryI'm not sure what you mean by copy
  - 2024-11-13 | it's much easier that way
  - 2024-11-13 | well then just create a new one if you haven't done anything with that old one
  - 2024-11-13 | you're not selling on that listing right
  - 2024-11-13 | no need to delete you can just leave it there
  - 2024-11-13 | then just create a new one tho
  - 2024-11-13 | do you HAVE TO use that same listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | that sheet is tricky lmk if you got stuck
  - 2024-11-13 | fill the ones outlined in red color
  - 2024-11-13 | anything that has the arrow must be picked not typed in
  - 2024-11-13 | fill out the template: you must use Microsoft Excel for this
  - 2024-11-13 | download the template in Catalog -> Upload via file -> Download template

  - 2024-11-04 | <@851966379971706880>
  - 2024-11-02 | Make sure you do the one that is for your stage

  - 2024-11-02 | Hi <@851966379971706880> this is your private channel
  - 2024-11-17 | can you make one?
  - 2024-11-16 | this market is getting saturated fast
  - 2024-11-16 | do you have the market analysis sheet?
  - 2024-11-16 | <@1218354786257076335> can you send your questions and product here, let's communicate here instead of dms
  - 2024-12-06 | 1. numbers are relative, you can prepare the sheet for Minh to check
2. it requires more work but doable, just make sure it's potential enough to take the risk
3. you can start llc, biz cc can be later after you find a potential product
  - 2024-12-01 | If it aids you on product research you can keep it otherwise we don't require anything beside Helium10
  - 2024-12-01 | What are the other 2 for? Product research?
  - 2024-11-30 | Yes you can do that to save fee now just remember to switch it later
  - 2024-11-26 | My best guess is Amazon hasn't produced the data of your product for helium10 yet
  - 2024-12-02 | Hey brother, I can take it from here regarding your continuation in the program.
  - 2024-12-05 | I know you can do this, don't give up yet
  - 2024-12-05 | hi <@973813470493573151> in order for you to excel in this program, we kindly ask to engage more by joining classes and be active in all channels. Students that are successful are the most active

  - 2024-12-03 | I've had a series of tough weeks with my health. I've had a bad cough for over a month now. Ever since my 4yo started school for the first time, I don't remember what it's like to feel healthy or even relatively normal.  Lol! I've heard from others that they've had similar experience. 
It's been a while since I've posted here. I'm currently talking with Macy about finding a supplier. I'm a bit torn bc the supplier is requiring MOQ of 1000 w/all the customization I'm hoping to beat the competition with. This is well above my means. I'm looking into building my credit to help but hoping I'm not digging more of a hole I can't get out of. I will see what I can do but wondering if I can get her to help me with just MOQ of 500.
  - 2024-10-10 | Thank you Minh!! I appreciate you taking the time to analyze all our products. I know it's been busy for you.
  - 2024-10-21 | USA
  - 2024-11-07 | 1. Continue communication w/Sourcing Agent about product
2. Order competitions' products to compare
  - 2024-10-30 | 1. Finish watching "Save time w/Sourcing agent" & contact one
2. Complete profit calculations (based on sourcing agent's fees & suppliers' quotes)

  - 2024-09-26 | Help Vietnam‚Äôs Storm Yagi Victims:
Let‚Äôs Do More Together!

What Happened?
Storm Yagi hit Vietnam with devastating force, leaving entire communities in ruins. Heavy rains and winds displaced thousands, flooding homes and destroying vital infrastructure. Many families are now left without shelter, food, or access to medical care. The destruction is widespread, with entire villages submerged under water and roads washed away. The storm has created a humanitarian crisis, and immediate relief is critical to help these communities rebuild and recover. Your support can bring hope to those affected by this disaster.

How Can We Help?


Dear AMZ Shifu family,

We‚Äôve already donated $4,000 to aid the victims of Storm Yagi in Vietnam, but the need is still overwhelming. Thousands of families have lost their homes and are in urgent need of support. We‚Äôre now reaching out to our incredible community to join us in making a bigger difference.

Even a small contribution can go a long way in providing food, shelter, and medical aid. Let‚Äôs stand together to help those in need.

Please donate today: https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/PW6NVEZZ2H3SN
Organization: https://www.khbetterfuture.org/

Thank you for your kindness and generosity!
With gratitude,

Justin & Charlie

  - 2024-01-16 | Hi everyone

@Christopher Villanueva  is trying to raise funds to finish equipping his new tutoring hall he has created in the Philippines to help all the kids in that small village. He has listed items on the fundraiser that we need to still purchase to begin enrollment in February, so we are hoping to receive all funds before then.

Also, any person donating $500 or more will be considered a founding sponsor and will have their name placed on a permanent plaque on the building.

I think this is a good time to give back, to help more and more people and a fresh start for 2024. For any additional information, feel free to ask here or send Christopher a message.

  - 2024-10-21 | Hi <@1244808317033906277>  , how is your product research going ?
Let us know if you have any questions
  - 2024-10-17 | You should negotiate to lower the MOQ down a bit , and ask them if you are able to pay for the customization
  - 2024-10-17 | In my opinion, it‚Äôs very important 
A nice packaging design will make your listing looks better, and you will also use it to make contents for social media + influencer marketing
  - 2024-10-16 | The goal for your first launching is to test out the market and to optimize your product 
After you sold out, you will gather all of the feedback from customers to improve your product.
1000 units is a high number, and I suggest to do around 200 to 300 for your first launching <@173853354374463489>
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you Shifu <@536075832658231299>

Here is the loom recording for your product analysis : https://www.loom.com/share/d91e6d529dae419b8e1cf0c8c12dfb37
  - 2024-10-14 | Yes there is a new tutorial video how to create shipping label 2024 update in Shifu Vault 

Amazon will tell you which location you need to ship them to, just create the shipping label and they will give you the warehouse ID <@1256245998255345695>
  - 2024-10-14 | You can reach out to both Macy and Alibaba at the same time sis, compare the price and go after the one saves more money for you. In the past couple months we have some members went with Alibaba inspection and it was good üëç 

Here is the inspection checklist üòä

You will need the shipping boxes dimensions to create shipping labels
  - 2024-10-29 | Hi <@505081578247159830> usually you will need to wait a couple hours so the UPC you've purchased will be verified in Amazon system, let me know if you still have the same issue in the next 3 hours
  - 2024-10-21 | Great job on this one <@505081578247159830> , yes please continue on your product research
  - 2024-10-21 | I saw the link Hannah 
It's a Wireless Car stereo-compatible

We don't recommend this market :
1. This category has a high return rate compared with other category
2. This category is very competitive, new sellers are trying to undercut pricing, and you also will get attacks from CN sellers
3. We experienced a higher rate of having Hijacker in this category
  - 2024-10-21 | https://www.loom.com/share/e0f2dac3b1ed40719fe43501abbc757f
  - 2024-10-21 | let me know if you have any questions
Again, confirm with me whenever you are done with your profit calculation sheet, we need to make sure it's more than 30% üòä
  - 2024-10-21 | Thank you sis <@505081578247159830> just want to make sure it's not in the Car-Electric category

Good job on this one, you can start on module #2
1. Create a dummy listing for this product
2. Practice communicating with your supplier
3. Work on your profit calculation sheet: make sure it's more than 30%
  - 2024-10-21 | Can you please tell me the category of this product first before we process to the next step ?

  - 2024-10-29 | So how do you determine what size tier the products are in?
  - 2024-10-14 | No problem! Don't be afraid to reach out! Im sure alot of us here are willing to help out if you need anything, myself included.
  - 2024-10-13 | Product research phase is not easy for sure guys. It took me 2-3 months of constant searching putting in 1-3 hours everyday. It will all be worth it when you find your potential product. Reverse lookup on Alibaba. Look on TikTok #tiktokmademebuyit, Brookstone, IG, Just to name a few. Look on other big company website and see what they are selling. Keep browsing around. Trust the process and don't lose faith! You got this! üí™üèº

  - 2024-11-06 | and cherry on top, yesterday I had the most impressions since my launch
  - 2024-11-06 | I was in the same boat with advertising eating my profits with little to no sales but ended up optimized my PPC. After optimization, I had the same results with impression, clicks, etc (surprisingly) and now it doesn't hurt as bad.

  - 2024-11-08 | Ill try to commit doing 40 questions a day and that would help me complete it to submit the next time
  - 2024-11-08 | Hey Jamie. Everything is going okay. Lately I just hired a VA to help me with my social media so after work (which is usually really late) I'm communicating with my VA to that up and running

  - 2024-10-12 | <@536075832658231299>  is it okay if I schedule my 1 on 1 call next week with you to help me optimize my campaign after looking at my ppc tracker?
  - 2024-10-10 | Thank you üôÇ
  - 2024-10-10 | Based off the homework, I'm assuming the CPC price
  - 2024-10-10 | When increasing/decreasing my bids, do I adjust it based off the my original bid price or the CPC price?
  - 2024-11-04 | It's the same offer. That's what I thought too. But I doubled checked with the Amazon representative bc I didn't see that it says 14 consecutive days. And that's why he said what he said in the email.
  - 2024-11-04 | 
  - 2024-11-04 | So I reached out to Amazon about the sponsored brands campaign and they said it has to start on or before 11/7/24 (the date the promotion ends) and it has to be running for at least 14 consecutive days. Just sharing some knowledge so you don't get caught off guard
  - 2024-11-03 | 
  - 2024-11-03 | Did you know that Amazon has an experiment feature in which you can experiment with different versions of content for your product. Just wanted to share what I learned today.
  - 2024-11-02 | I will in the future when I'm eligible to make "deals" but currently I don't meet the requirements for the deal
  - 2024-11-02 | Right? When I saw that from my competitor.... I was like... üòë FAKE SALEEEEE!! But smartüò≠
  - 2024-11-02 | https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1293219742408114208/1302366369328922624/Screenshot_2024-11-02_151840.png?ex=6727dab3&is=67268933&hm=4ef57a97ab5694c2c03257c750b8b43cc12eed5f83604a74f4d184585a67016c&
  - 2024-11-02 | And for those asking about the criteria for the lightning deal..or deals in general
  - 2024-11-02 | Using the lightning deal promotion as leverage
  - 2024-11-02 | It's basically a "fake" sale like how you mentioned
  - 2024-11-02 | So my top competitor sells his product with the coupon. And when he has a lightning deal, the coupon gets removed and the lightning deal is the same price as how much it would have been with the coupon

  - 2024-11-29 | November 28, 2024. Happy Thanksgiving everyone! 
It‚Äôs been a while since I last shared an update. The past few weeks have been challenging for me. I‚Äôve been struggling to manage my schedule while juggling school, work, and family issues. After a call with Shifu <@975774205658411068>  , I realized that my main challenge is time management. To address this, I‚Äôve started dedicating two hours late at night to watch class recordings, especially on PPC. I‚Äôve also been reaching out to other mentees for support, and fortunately, they‚Äôve been incredibly helpful. I look at amz seller board, I‚Äôve come to understand that if I don‚Äôt stay focused and spend time, I won‚Äôt see the results I‚Äôm aiming for.

If got organic sales could decrease budget daily?

  - 2024-12-01 | I think my sales improved this month compared to the previous one because I developed a clearer understanding of PPC, keywords, and impressions and Also, the Black Friday boost also played a significant role in increasing sales.
Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled with PPC lessons and worked hard to understand how it all works. I realized how crucial keywords are, and I applied what I learned from Han and Susan‚Äôs classes. I started by turning off keywords which not get sales. adding new ones to test the market. I saw positive results within a few weeks. And will continue submitting PPC assitant for optimization every 2 weeks to keep improving.

  - 2024-10-10 | Thu Nguyen - thunguyen0056
  - 2024-11-29 | I‚Äôm concerned because Amazon has blocked my listing a couple of times when I updated images, changes descriptions or uploaded a video. üôà
  - 2024-11-29 | thank you sis! üòÅ
  - 2024-11-29 | could I add video of an influencer from Tiktok to my listing AMZ? a video is unboxing of product. anything about copy right?
  - 2024-11-30 | could i increase my budget each ppc? it is out of budget around 3 pm cst.
  - 2024-11-29 | hi Han, i resubmit ppc.
  - 2024-08-19 | I remember from the tutorial that if the budget runs out in the afternoon, around 3-4 pm, should I increase the budget, or should I wait and optimize after two weeks?
  - 2024-12-03 | thanks Han!
  - 2024-12-03 | have you recommend anyone?
  - 2024-12-03 | how can i resolve this problem? i was not sure why it happened?
  - 2024-11-09 | thank you Han! I will do it . I feel better now. I'm struggling in last couple weeks. It overload to me.
  - 2024-11-09 | So could I find a new keywords or still keep the old one? I haven't turn off auto and ultimate yet.
  - 2024-11-09 | I just concern that I take a look ppc in 2 weeks feel lost much money and don't get sales. üôà
  - 2024-11-09 | So I can turn on ppc again when the inventory full?
  - 2024-11-09 | i don't optimize every day. in couple days, i take a look if keywords didn't make sales I will bids down or turn off.
  - 2024-11-09 | So, I don't keep in my eyes in ppc, it looks like spending much money but not sales. That's a reason I need someone ppc assitant in short term.
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi Han, 3 things are ppc, fbm review and post instagram in single day.
  - 2024-11-07 | Hi Han, how are you doing? Susan suggested me DM you to help. honestly  I am focus in my last semester to complete Master degree. My inventory is low. I turn off my ppc last week. The second bulk is in bound. Honestly I don't spend time in ppc much. Could I hire someone to take care of it for black Friday sales? Please advise, I'm a bit stressed now.
  - 2024-11-07 | Oh ok I will DM to Han. Thanks Susan!
  - 2024-11-07 | My inventory is low. I turn off my ppc last week. The second bulk is in bound. Honestly I don't spend time in ppc much. Could I hire someone to take care of it for black Friday sales? Please advise, I'm a bit stressed now.
  - 2024-11-07 | Hello, honestly  I am focus in my last semester to complete Master degree. I don't have time to join the class. Sorry about unconvinced. I need advice right now.
  - 2024-10-30 | can i send the spreadsheet to airtable to optimize ppc?
  - 2024-10-30 | Do I to research new key words in ppc for second bulk order?
  - 2024-10-23 | Can I sell another product while the selling the first one?
  - 2024-10-23 | My second bulk order on the way to warehouse. I also find influencer. And build up more reviews. Could I find another potential product?
  - 2024-10-15 | Thanks Susan! It's clarifying to me.

(SUNDAY FULLY REST)

Check-in here to let us know how close you were to the goals you set at the beginning of this week to receive accountability coaching/support to move the needle forward in your business. REMEMBER, you don't have to be perfect or hit all your goals week to week.  As long as you are 1% more than the week before, that's what matters This journey is a marathon, not a sprint! 
[do this each week] Answer the questions below:

A. Reflection: 
Are you able to hit the goals that you have set from the beginning of the week?
-If you have -> I want you to reward yourself with a treat (either eating at your fav restaurant or watching your fav movie) 
If you haven't -> I want you to still reward yourself with 50 squats /pushups, though, remember, at least you paid up and know that you can restart and get rid of the sense of guilt inside.
Reflect on what are the MAIN roadblocks/distractions from the previous week that you were facing. ( BE HONEST; WE ARE FAMILY. Share it and receive suggestions from those who have solved it)
What are the two possible solutions/actions that you will take to reduce/remove/replace these roadblocks or distractions so you can move closer to your goal?
-Share your MAIN WHYS to remind yourself of why you are on this journey. 

B.Planning next week's goal: 
What stage are you on this journey?
-What are your three main goals to focus on that will move the needle forward (the 20% that generate 80% results) ?
What support processes do you need to make that happen?

(SUNDAY FULLY REST)

Check-in here to let us know how close you were to the goals you set at the beginning of this week to receive accountability coaching/support to move the needle forward in your business. REMEMBER, you don't have to be perfect or hit all your goals week to week.  As long as you are 1% more than the week before, that's what matters This journey is a marathon, not a sprint! 
[do this each week] Answer the questions below:

A. Reflection: 
Are you able to hit the goals that you have set from the beginning of the week?
-If you have -> I want you to reward yourself with a treat (either eating at your fav restaurant or watching your fav movie) 
If you haven't -> I want you to still reward yourself with 50 squats /pushups, though, remember, at least you paid up and know that you can restart and get rid of the sense of guilt inside.
Reflect on what are the MAIN roadblocks/distractions from the previous week that you were facing. ( BE HONEST; WE ARE FAMILY. Share it and receive suggestions from those who have solved it)
What are the two possible solutions/actions that you will take to reduce/remove/replace these roadblocks or distractions so you can move closer to your goal?
-Share your MAIN WHYS to remind yourself of why you are on this journey. 

B.Planning next week's goal: 
What stage are you on this journey?
-What are your three main goals to focus on that will move the needle forward (the 20% that generate 80% results) ?
What support processes do you need to make that happen?

Post below so we can follow up with you and help you move forward.

2. You will face a lot of rejection-> never give up. All you need is one yes
3. Positioning and INSIST on the opputunity. Never say no to anything that can promote your products , if Robert never left his book at the "high end" car wash after his friend decline , he won't have the amway ceo to promote that book to operas

4. stop making excuses and start saying more yes to oops that grow your biz : if Robert never flies back from his hunting trip > he will never be on Oprah

Why can't you be the one to stop generational trauma for your family?

Why not become the first millionaire in your lineage?

Why not help more people?

This isn't just about motivation-this is pure logic.

If you have one shot at this thing called life...
If you're unhappy with where you are...
If your loved ones need help...
If you're already carrying regret and guilt...

Then why not be the one to change it all?

  - 2024-11-19 | Takeaways from Tony‚Äôs Journey:

1. Persistence Pays Off
Tony didn‚Äôt stop at the first or even the fourth flop. Flier #5 was the game-changer. Most people give up too soon, but success often hides just one step further than you think.

2. Good Copywriting is Leverage
The difference between a dud and a hit wasn‚Äôt luck‚Äîit was the message. Tony understood his audience and crafted words that resonated. The right words can open doors, and in this case, flood a website.

3. Strategic Distribution is Everything
Tony didn‚Äôt just throw his fliers anywhere. He placed them near Amazon offices, where his target audience‚Äîand potential amplifiers‚Äîwere most likely to notice. Go where your customers already are.

4. Luck Favors Preparation
The Reddit post and Twitter virality weren‚Äôt accidents. They were the result of Tony‚Äôs groundwork. His success is a reminder that ‚Äúluck‚Äù is often a combination of effort and timing.

5. Creativity + Hustle = Opportunities
Tony didn‚Äôt have a big budget, a fancy website, or years of experience. What he had was hustle, creativity, and the willingness to try something different. Those ingredients can take you far.

6. The Power of Resilience
Imagine if Tony stopped at Flier #4. The difference between success and failure is often resilience in the face of rejection. Keep iterating and testing until you find what works.

The Lesson?

Great copy + smart distribution is the ultimate cheat code. And when paired with persistence, it‚Äôs game over for the competition.

Would you stop after your 4th flop? Or would you push for your own version of Flier #5?

@everyone
  - 2024-11-19 | The Flier blew up this guys biz & how you can blow up your biz, to bring sales üòÜ, not that boomboom 

Tony was just a broke Doordash driver with a dream and a printer. He made six versions of a flier for his delivery service.

Flier #1? Crickets.
Flier #2? Nope.
#3 and #4? Still nothing.

But Flier #5? That one hit.

Tony printed 300 copies, spent 4 days plastering them around Amazon‚Äôs Seattle office, and crossed his fingers. Day 4? Boom‚Äîit went viral on Reddit. Day 5? Twitter blew up.

Now Tony‚Äôs website is swamped, with backlinks from major sites.

  - 2024-11-18 | 9. If you‚Äôre procrastinating on something, work on it for just 5 minutes. 

An inch of ACTION goes farther than a mile of THINKING ü§î 

10. 4 hours of Deep work is far better than 12 hours of distracted work.

  - 2024-11-18 | 15 Millionaire Productivity strategies. I used these tips to make my first mil as well! 

1. Write down your Top 3 Priorities every morning (or the night before)

2. Divide your day into blocks of time & assign tasks directly into your calendar.

3. If rest increases your output per unit of time, then it was productive. 

Nap strategically üò¥

4. If it‚Äôs not on your calendar, it probably won‚Äôt happen. Time Block it & get it done within the time frame. üìÖ 

5. Write a "Not-To-Do List", your biggest productivity killers to avoid. No Porn, No Scrolling & turn Off all notifications üõë

6. If a task takes less than 2 minutes, DO it NOW! #DontThinkJustDO

7. Being able to receive feedback without taking it personally is a superpower. 

Ask & be open to Feedback from peeps you respect.

8. Your energy is determined by the quality of your Sleep, diet & exercise. Sleep your way to the top babyüèÜ

  - 2024-10-22 | Third Habit: Follow-Up Routine with Key Team Members and Suppliers
Before this change, I sometimes felt disconnected from my team and suppliers, and it was impacting my brand‚Äôs growth. So, I made it a habit to regularly check in with key team members and suppliers. Every Friday, I‚Äôd have a quick call or send an update to make sure everyone was aligned and things were running smoothly. It was like oiling the gears of a machine‚Äîthose small conversations helped keep everything moving efficiently and strengthened the trust in my network.
The Result?
Over time, these small habits compounded. My business flourished, and for the first time, I found something even more precious: time. Time to spend with loved ones, time to explore new hobbies and even time to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee without feeling guilty.

And so, I discovered that success doesn‚Äôt have to come at the cost of everything else‚Äîit can come from small, consistent habits that lead to big growth.

Quick question: Have you applied this to your business and life yet? Comment below and let me know what you think
  - 2024-10-22 | ‚ÄúSuccess doesn‚Äôt come from one big move‚Äîit‚Äôs built from the small habits you practice every day.‚Äù
 Intrigued, I decided to try a new approach, focusing on building small, consistent habits.

First Habit: Daily Planning
Each morning, I took just five minutes to jot down the top three tasks that would have the biggest impact on my business. It was like planting seeds in a garden‚Äîsmall efforts, but with time and patience, they grew into big results. Suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt just busy; I was focused. No more endless to-do lists and overwhelming chaos‚Äîjust three powerful actions to move the needle each day.

Second Habit: Batching Tasks
I used to jump from one task to another, putting out fires everywhere. But then, I decided to try something different: batching tasks. On Mondays, I dedicated the whole day to creating content‚Äîno meetings, no distractions, just pure creative flow. It was like getting in the zone, and the productivity was off the charts! Content creation became an easy, enjoyable rhythm instead of a constant source of stress.

  - 2024-12-03 | If I had given up on my Amazon journey from the start, my life would have been stuck in the same cycle: doing nails, working a job, and longing for days off just to spend time with my mom or dream about traveling.

Growth demands sacrifices. It‚Äôs like the gym‚Äîevery drop of sweat and every ache you feel today becomes the strength you‚Äôll carry tomorrow. Albert Einstein once said, 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.'

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck or behind, something in your life needs to change. Something old must be let go, and something new must take its place. If you don‚Äôt make the sacrifice now, it won‚Äôt just be your dreams on the line‚Äîit could be your loved ones' future, your financial stability, and your kids‚Äô opportunities that end up being the ultimate sacrifice.

The question is: What will you choose to let go of today to create the life you‚Äôve always dreamed of?"

lesson: *HACK* Save time with sourcing agent:

ABOUT THIS LESSON
If time isn't your friend, I highly recommend hiring a sourcing agent to help you do all the communication with manufacturers so that it saves you time and Fastrack your progress.

A sourcing agent will represent you to do all the groundwork and this allows you to focus on the most important task which is product development and planning your marketing plan. A sourcing agent can also help you get different products and bundle them together for your main product.

To conclude, getting a sourcing agent is the fastest way to save time. It's an investment for long-term scalability and time-saving.

  - 2024-12-01 | --Improved Review 2: Finally, a Bottle That Lasts!
*"I‚Äôve owned a few hydrogen water bottles over the years, and durability has always been an issue for me. My last one, [competitor‚Äôs product], stopped working after just two months‚Äîsuper disappointing, especially given how much I paid for it.

This one, though, feels like it‚Äôs built to last. It‚Äôs sturdy and reliable, and after using it daily for a few months now, it still works perfectly. I will say it‚Äôs a little heavier than my old bottle, which makes it less convenient to carry around everywhere, but I‚Äôll take that trade-off for something that doesn‚Äôt break.

If you‚Äôre tired of wasting money on bottles that don‚Äôt hold up, I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving this one a shot. It‚Äôs worth it for the peace of mind alone."*

---Improved Review 3: Customer Support That Actually Helps
*"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but I had to for this one because the customer service stood out to me so much. My last bottle (from [competitor‚Äôs product]) had some issues, and trying to get in touch with their support team was a nightmare‚Äîthey basically ghosted me.

When I had a small question about this bottle‚Äôs charging, I reached out to the seller, and they got back to me within hours. They even sent me a quick video that explained everything I needed. That kind of responsiveness is rare these days, and it made me feel good about the purchase.

The bottle itself has been great so far‚Äîconsistent hydrogen levels, and the battery lasts longer than I expected. My only nitpick? I wish it came in more colors. But honestly, that‚Äôs me being picky. Overall, super happy with it, and it‚Äôs refreshing to deal with a brand that actually cares about its customers."*
  - 2024-12-01 | Example: Product Hydrogen water bottle (side note: this market is very competitive and requires high capital; I would not recommend it for beginners with a low budget)

A. Here's a basic Review:
"Customer service was amazing for this product. There was a QR code inside that you can scan if you need assistance and I had a question about washing the bottle. I scanned it and got a response in 3 minutes. The agent was extremely friendly and helpful. My question was answered immediately"

B. Here are 3 written ChatGPT reviews 

--Improved Review 1: Reliable Performance That Lives Up to the Hype
*"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a good hydrogen water bottle for a while now. I had tried [competitor‚Äôs product] before, and let‚Äôs just say it didn‚Äôt quite live up to its claims‚Äîthe hydrogen levels weren‚Äôt anywhere near what they advertised, and I ended up feeling like I wasted my money.

When I came across this bottle, I was a bit skeptical, but it‚Äôs honestly been such a pleasant surprise. I tested the hydrogen levels, and they‚Äôre exactly what‚Äôs promised. That‚Äôs a huge relief because I rely on this for better energy and mental clarity after workouts.

One thing I‚Äôd say is I wish the setup instructions were a little more detailed, but the product itself is solid. It works well, and I‚Äôve already recommended it to a couple of friends who were as frustrated as I was with other brands."*

  - 2024-11-26 | https://truthbook.com/jesus/the-death-of-joseph/
  - 2024-11-26 | What I was just eye-opening to learn at church today 

Jesus' dad, Saint Joseph, passed away
Jesus was just 13 -14 y/o facing the world himself
He was forced to grow up early
to take care of his widowed mom, Mary & his 7 siblings
---
Jesus worried about his widow mom
knowing that his destiny he soon will die in his 30s.

that's why he helped raise a widow's son from death to life,
to give her hope of the future 

that's why he appreciated the homeless widow giving everything she had for the church,
to honor her faith and sacrifices
--
FYI: Jewish women rely on their husbands and sons > if they have no one left, many of them would go homeless and live day by day. 

He just like us! Struggling through to taking care of our loved ones

  - 2024-12-05 | Hi <@1059659092475531444> , no worries I'm in a better place than where i was at last week. i do agree with that cause my mental health just started to decline.  Will do and will take care when its time i will be ready. üòé
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi <@1059659092475531444>,

currently not doing well. in a lowest point in life. lots of emotional outbrust Process is going okay but decide to take some time off first so currently on pause. will be back soon should be in a couple of days because i feel alot better than where i was at in the past 1-2 weeks . 

progress is going at a good pace for the past 3-4 months and was going a rate that I think was okay and didn't felt too rush. im sure there was will be challenges i will be facing soon but 

will be back and ready to take it on
  - 2024-11-26 | Got it, will take that into factor with the freight forwarder
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi Jamie, thanks for the advice and head up about comparing shipping cost. Will go ahead and do that
  - 2024-11-26 | overall you guys had experience this the past what would be the better chocie ?
  - 2024-11-26 | When having the product ship from the supplier facotry. It is better to have the supplier ship it or should the inspector who offer the service do it ?
  - 2024-11-17 | but yeah I will work my supplier on that part to get the battery exemption sheet
  - 2024-11-17 | I think the issue was that I had put another market place instead of the us so i went ahead and make new a listing for it so now I am able to print the item label
  - 2024-11-17 | on the good news I got the item label
  - 2024-11-17 | yeah air duster
ohhhh okay Ill go ahead and ask my supplier for that as well
  - 2024-11-16 | <@536075832658231299>  I didnt do the battery exemption sheet cause the product does have battery in it. 

CC: <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444>
  - 2024-11-16 | wait another day to see if anything changes ?
  - 2024-11-16 | Should I create a new listing ?
  - 2024-11-16 | 
  - 2024-11-16 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444> 

still having the same issue from yesterday
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> let me try it again tonight. Currently stuck at the work office
  - 2024-11-15 | yeah was trying to trouble shoot this but stuck at the moment
  - 2024-11-15 | but I got confused when speaking with them on the phone
  - 2024-11-15 | the item label to apply on the box
  - 2024-11-15 | Cause I thought you just need to hit print label item and it should be good to go ?
  - 2024-11-15 | unless it should be a quick print ?
  - 2024-11-15 | contact seller suppor team and these are steps they told me before printing out the label (barcode)
  - 2024-11-15 | watching the the tutorial minh sent over too. trying to retrace my steps and seeing where I went wrong but cant seem troubleshoot correctly to find the root cause
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | <@1059659092475531444> clicked "print item label" from FBA listing and this pop up
  - 2024-11-15 | <@1059659092475531444> this is what i have at the moment
  - 2024-11-15 | just got this email
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | its on FBA
  - 2024-11-15 | So i did that  and having the same issue
  - 2024-11-15 | i think it has to be realting to the label
  - 2024-11-15 | my supplier asked me just now
  - 2024-11-15 | what does it mean by shipping is mark ?
  - 2024-11-15 | okay let me try that
  - 2024-11-15 | is there a way to change it or do i need to create another listing ?
  - 2024-11-15 | cause I believe i had create this one and select FMB
  - 2024-11-15 | so making a listing for fba ?
  - 2024-11-15 | ohhhh okay
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | just trying to see if i have miss anything
  - 2024-11-15 | it should be there but each time I press it it said item not submiteed
  - 2024-11-15 | Im trying to print the label item so I can sent it to my supplier
  - 2024-11-15 | Hello guys
  - 2024-10-20 | got it thanks for clearing it up on that for now i will select one just get things going
  - 2024-10-20 | How would I go about this ?
  - 2024-10-20 | When trying to pick a warehouse loation, there is not one in the state where my LLC regiestered. in this case should I go ahead and pick one in CA ??
  - 2024-10-18 | I will probably use a warehouse in the state my LLC is registered so that it make okay for now
  - 2024-10-18 | for the meantime
  - 2024-10-18 | thanks for head up but will see where this lead to
  - 2024-10-18 | oh nooooo
  - 2024-10-18 | when you said there no issue on shipping
  - 2024-10-18 | but I rather take that route to be honest
  - 2024-10-18 | but after this make more sense
  - 2024-10-18 | yeah cause I was gonna use a warehouse location in wyoming for now
  - 2024-10-18 | okay that alot more sense now
  - 2024-10-18 | ohhhhh okay
  - 2024-10-18 | not sure if that was the right reponse but it was a try
  - 2024-10-18 | i think for their shipping quote is through sea freight with DDP (postal service)
  - 2024-10-18 | its for the tax exempt part
  - 2024-10-18 | until everything is finalize then it will be change
  - 2024-10-18 | cause I was gonna give my supplier one of the warehouse from the state that my LLC is registered in for now
  - 2024-10-18 | from their side ?
  - 2024-10-18 | not sure which warehouse
  - 2024-10-18 | shipping is $423
  - 2024-10-18 | yes that is what I meant
  - 2024-10-18 | Good morning Minh 

Ohhhhh okay that make more sense thanks for clearing it up

For the estimate shipping cost that even applied if the supplier give you the shipping cost with the MOQ as well ?

  - 2024-10-15 | Han! I accidentally made  two appointments with you for next week. Just keep the one on Tuesday at 4.

  - 2024-11-21 | I thought I replied already but don‚Äôt see it for some reason lol sorry - the BFCM discount should override your coupon
  - 2024-11-06 | It can be the same
  - 2024-11-06 | I think this is a new feature. Just make sure it gets relisted within 30 days from when you got the stranded inventory notification or your goods will get sent back to you.

  - 2024-12-05 | <@1230862203146473472> can you share with the group how you were able to get access to premium a+ within 1-2 days after contacting amazon support? what did you do, which outlets did you contact and how quickly were you able to resolve it?
  - 2024-12-04 | what is it asking for
  - 2024-11-22 | Han might have some useful tips. In the past, I tried tracking the times of day when orders were placed‚Äîearly morning, mid-day, or evening‚Äîto see if there was a specific trend. The idea was to allocate more budget during peak times using Amazon PPC‚Äôs time scheduling feature. However, my product didn‚Äôt show a consistent trend, so I ended up not utilizing the time scheduling tool.
  - 2024-10-23 | that's fine. raise your price too <@1167106129415909496>
  - 2024-10-08 | i personally look at each campaign individually. if they are performing (i.e. making sales and meeting target acos or lower, i will increase. if it's just a bit above target acos, i would still increase). if they haven't performed at all, i will not increase.
  - 2024-10-11 | <@809813064756887582> post your info here so han can get you added to private channel
  - 2024-12-05 | have them send it to you directly and you can replace it. we want to minimize returns to amazon.
  - 2024-12-03 | Olesia had this idea before.

<@536075832658231299> do you want to share your opinion on it? we talked about this recently.
  - 2024-11-21 | We make our own as every product is unique. Main thing you‚Äôll want to check is that all the features work as you advertise it, quality or printing/logo, specs (weight/measurements) if important, all components are in the box, and insert/card manual <@505081578247159830>
  - 2024-11-20 | it should automatically override with the bigger discount (which is the BF)
  - 2024-11-19 | yes they can but usually not significant
  - 2024-11-19 | not sure why this happens - it happens to me too. i'll usually go into edit and republish my manychat and that seems to fix it - though not permanently.
  - 2024-11-18 | <@1230862203146473472> can you let <@750566740424917045> know who/what number/email you contacted to help you get premium a+ access?

  - 2024-10-17 | <@809813064756887582>
  - 2024-08-09 | This is correct!
  - 2024-08-08 | See ^ - higher means harder and more competitive to rank on. It's good if you are meeting those numbers, but as a new seller we need to balance using a good mix of higher and lower cpr words with a decent search volume.
  - 2024-08-08 | 
  - 2024-10-29 | Seems like I need to do this homework too üòÇ
  - 2024-12-02 | yes this is right
  - 2024-11-10 | Who left the review?
  - 2024-11-03 | 20% off your current selling price
  - 2024-11-03 | i believe it has to be 20% minimum discount from the lowest price you've been selling at. han correct me if i'm wrong.
  - 2024-11-03 | i usually just do the % off and then set minimum price but there's no wrong way
  - 2024-12-06 | Love how resourceful you are!
  - 2024-12-06 | it got pushed down to the bottom of the listing w/ shoppable videos
  - 2024-12-06 | <@536075832658231299> do you know if amz changed this process? i haven't uploaded a video in the last 2 months. when we uploaded olesia's it didn't show up next to her listing images.
  - 2024-12-05 | <@1230862203146473472> add coupon to your listing
  - 2024-11-17 | olesia i will do this for you today.

but if you go to inventory, manage all inventory, click edit on the FBA listing, all the copy will be on the product details tab
  - 2024-11-15 | be sure to select han
  - 2024-11-15 | you can book your call with han - https://amzshifu.com/coach-1on1
  - 2024-10-20 | there's really no way of knowing so don't stress too hard on this
  - 2024-10-20 | you can pick any to get a quote. just keep in mind that if you pick one in CA, shipping may end up being higher if that's the the one your goods get sent to
  - 2024-10-18 | this happened to me on my first bulk order
  - 2024-10-18 | sucks to be quoted 400 for WC then when you actually do shipping, you have to ship to a bunch of EC warehouses and the rate is 1000
  - 2024-10-18 | oh that will probably be expensive but you won't have any surprises when you actually ship haha
  - 2024-10-18 | my guess is most will try using a west coast warehouse to show the cheapest rate
  - 2024-10-18 | yeah so it could be worth asking or maybe you can say, can you quote me to ship to X warehouse at amazon
  - 2024-10-18 | this is the "Warehouse ID"
  - 2024-10-18 | yes but to get quote they would have to know "we are shipping from china to amz warehouse MDW2" or something like that
  - 2024-10-18 | i'm wondering what destination they used to get their shipping quote... because WC rates will be much less than EC or midwest. but yes def ask about one near you.

if needed you can check with a few shipping agents to compare too.
  - 2024-10-18 | do you know which warehouse was used as point of reference?
  - 2024-10-18 | as far as the shipping cost/unit itself?
  - 2024-10-18 | do you know what the break down is?
  - 2024-10-18 | you mean your supplier already gave you a shipping estimate, which was included in your total bulk order?
  - 2024-11-18 | omg an, CONGRATS. my husband and i shot vietnamese american weddings for the longest time. got me feeling all nostalgic over here lol! can't imagine how exhausted you might be haha
  - 2024-10-10 | I usually go off cpc if I need to aggressively bring acos down, otherwise I go off the current bid

Your bid is the max you‚Äôre willing to pay
  - 2024-10-14 | i would just close if 2 units. when is your next batch coming?
  - 2024-10-14 | thats fine
  - 2024-10-14 | just make sure you reopen before 30 days so the units don't get returned to you
  - 2024-10-14 | how long has it been? the 30 day rule han mentioned before still applies and amazon may automatically reopen your listing
  - 2024-10-14 | it could be returns, could be. units they lost and found. this happens often
  - 2024-11-24 | i had this issue recenlty
  - 2024-11-24 | go edit and republish your manychat
  - 2024-11-03 | han and minh both may have different approach too! but that's what i do
  - 2024-11-03 | there's no right or wrong way to do this as i believe it's preference. so you can do a bulk adjustment (decrease by %, then increase after it's over). i cherry picked the ones that were bleeding out during that timeframe
  - 2024-11-03 | i also drop my budget
  - 2024-11-03 | when i notice that their deal is cannibalizing my sales
  - 2024-11-03 | i do
  - 2024-10-28 | phuong i sent you a video on where/how to export like 2 weeks ago
  - 2024-10-28 | have you checked the market? last week, i noticed my sales were sooooo slow. when that happens i often look at my market to see what's happening. i found out my top competitor was running a limited time deal 7 days, priced 15 cheaper than my product. the sale ended last night and my sales seem to have returned to normal.
  - 2024-10-17 | but if they find the units later, they'll take the money back
  - 2024-10-17 | if it's their fault i believe they'll reimburse you
  - 2024-10-17 | yeah your invoice should be fine in this case. i think this is a new process. i have had so many discrepancies and they never asked me to upload anything. only  one time when they said they didn't have an entire shipment.
  - 2024-10-15 | In general if the quality is worthy of purchasing. Do you think it‚Äôs worth using as an ad later in the future? That kind of thing
  - 2024-10-15 | i found a way to do this but it's tricky and requires some trial and error. he might ask you to take it down if he catches it too... just a note

500 is not really bad, if he won't negotiate down, ask if you can decide after the video has been posted. that way you know if it's worth your time or not
  - 2024-10-15 | i wonder if you can just download the story once it's live lol let me test
  - 2024-10-15 | i think it's a good test, but try to see if you can get a copy of that video
  - 2024-10-15 | and is it a story series for just 1 story slide?
  - 2024-10-15 | see if he will share the story video with you after (like for you to keep for yourself)
  - 2024-10-15 | what %?
  - 2024-10-15 | did he send you proof of big US audience?
  - 2024-10-21 | this can happen anytime. the market moves fast. speed of execution is key.
  - 2024-10-17 | I skipped package design on my first batch. It‚Äôs a nice touch but not worth risking if you‚Äôre required To have 1000 units. I did custom package on second batch.
  - 2024-10-16 | too risky. agree with minh üëÜ need proof of concept first
  - 2024-11-02 | i always recommend having a list or idea of what you need. for example: 

- 2 product shots on white background
- 5 lifestyle photos with product (briefly describe setting/mood/vibe and whether it should or should not have people)

if you're not good at describing, create a pinterest moodboard to share w/ photographer.

you cannot rely on someone especially graphic designer or photographer to communicate your brand.

if you're not sure how much you need, it might be better to plan the website first and ask for photo assets later. Or - if you don't know but want the photos first, you can just ask for flat 10-15 pics that you can repurpose and use for anything else.
  - 2024-10-31 | can you send me a google doc - what images/how many
  - 2024-10-29 | I tagged you in a thread in active support
  - 2024-10-29 | are you sea shipping? sometimes they cannot provide a tracking #
  - 2024-10-16 | inspection is similar price for everyone. shipping is where rates can vary - and reasonable is subjective as everyone's product size, type, etc varies. things to consider if it's reasonable for you:

1. does it significantly impact your overall margin? 
2. have you gotten 2-3 other quotes to compare so you stretch every penny you can?
3. how long will it take? 
4. do you need to get it here faster? if so, do you need to consider partial air and sea shipping.

  - 2024-10-11 | i know... i'm just thinking we at least want him to post it lol
  - 2024-10-11 | maybe something less snarky so he actually posts it? something along these lines... just a thought - maybe you can merge the two somehow or feel free to post your response üòÖ 

Thank you for sending over the video this morning. We truly appreciate your patience and understanding throughout the process, especially given the initial delay caused by the software update. While we had communicated our decision to part ways due to the extended timeline, we‚Äôd be happy to move forward with the first posting of the video and will no longer request the payment. We‚Äôre grateful for your effort and contribution, and we‚Äôd love to conclude our sponsorship on a positive note. Thank you again
  - 2024-10-11 | i'm thinking the same. he has 31k subscribers on youtube. i suggested taking the shitty video and not moving forward with second video
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont want him to make a video NOT recommending it or talking about how much it sucks
  - 2024-12-02 | 50k was my bulk order for q1 earlier this year
  - 2024-12-02 | i don't think i spent 50k. it was more like 30k
  - 2024-12-02 | i made profit on my third batch
  - 2024-11-19 | because if you are and adding a 20% discount for the event then don't mess w/ your price till after the event
  - 2024-11-19 | are you participating in BF/CM?
  - 2024-11-04 | give me 5 mins. is that good for you?
  - 2024-11-04 | Well 9 est for me
  - 2024-11-04 | Yes
  - 2024-10-29 | you can drop price to see if it drives more sales. 

have you played with optimizing your listing images?
  - 2024-10-15 | you have to make a copy of the sheet tam (file > make a copy)
  - 2024-10-15 | this one?
  - 2024-10-15 | make a copy of it then you can edit
  - 2024-10-15 | get it from the PPC Tracking Tutorial
in the PPC module in the vault. han has a video for how to work it too.
  - 2024-10-14 | i still get stressed out and lose sleep over inventory and shipping. it never ends lol
  - 2024-12-06 | Glad to see you here Tim!!! üôèüèªüôèüèª
  - 2024-12-03 | I responded to tam already. I can share a quick breakdown of my knowledge but honestly I still find this hard to track especially if there are breaks between selling.

"So after barebone listing, should i create a contract with supplier and schedule a call with the instructors so i can place the bulk order?"

<@1054411267340763216> is thuy required to schedule a call before the bulk order?
  - 2024-11-14 | <@536075832658231299> did you know carolina is selling at 15% margin right now? she's 50% through her inventory, i was wondering if we should bring up her price?
  - 2024-10-14 | should be good
  - 2024-10-14 | make sure you sell some FBM at the 30% higher price
  - 2024-10-14 | ignore sale price bc you're not running a sale.

make list price 30% higher than your price
  - 2024-10-14 | <@613172337470341150> share the screen on your pricing. what's it look like righ tnow

  - 2024-10-15 | Amazon can hold payment for over 14 days, as an ‚Äúaccount level reserve.‚Äù This is something you agreed to, when you signed up.

The reserve amount is determined by various things. These include how long you‚Äôve had your account, returns, reviews, and if you have any unresolved disputes.

if everything is good, you will eventually be paid out for everything just takes some time at first
  - 2024-10-15 | <@1213335800205414452> sorry for the delay. reposting your ? here in case han can provide better explanation too

" I was not sure about Account Level Reserved. Why amz keep much on these?"
  - 2024-10-21 | justin/chuong plus minh and i are also in here but no one else from the program.
  - 2024-12-06 | amazon probably has it's own logic of applying what they think is most relevant and sorts it that way but we are looking for the low hanging fruits, which may not be those top performing/relevant keywords.
  - 2024-12-05 | <@1212209797345185883> following up from class. the top performing keywords for me were not all from top suggested keywords list. only one of them was.
  - 2024-12-01 | but i haven't tracked it closely and consistently so han could be right
  - 2024-12-01 | from my own experience, i don't think it's included in the units sold but it gets deducted from inventory
  - 2024-10-23 | I usually just take a verbal agreement in email or whatever communication channel
  - 2024-10-17 | you mean NOT the friends and family thing. so it will be a business transaction
  - 2024-10-17 | their preferred method. for all of mine, it has been paypal

what's standard - also paypal
  - 2024-10-17 | i also pay every influencer after they make the video
  - 2024-10-17 | someone recently paid a deposit and the influencer did not deliver
  - 2024-10-17 | it's standard from my experience over the past decade to pay after the assets are delivered

"in helium10, for some reason my Top Keywords section has been N/A ever since the beginning of time even though I've been selling for some time. Do you know the reason for it? I have checked all my competitors and other products all have Top Keywords list, but not mine.
Thank you in advance!"

  - 2024-12-04 | Thanks Jamie! I was thinking to ask the customer to send me image or video of the product to show me the issue so that I can better assist.
  - 2024-12-04 | Can they send images or video through Amazon ?
  - 2024-12-04 | I received a message from a customer in Seller Central. Is it okay to ask them to message me on Messenger for better assistance, or would that violate Amazon's regulations?
  - 2024-11-07 | Yes, this happened to me as well! To resolve it, I had to send Amazon the supplier's invoice, which prompted them to start an investigation. Fortunately, they found the missing units. Otherwise, they might have simply labeled the shipment as having a discrepancy, and that would be the end of it.

  - 2024-12-02 | Robert Kiyosaki's shift in mindset came from Dr. R  rejection and  his question: "What does God want done?" instead of focusing solely on personal wealth. He realized that the purpose behind his creation Rich Dad Poor Dad was to serve others through financial education. The video remind us that business success comes not from taking, but from meeting customers' needs and creating meaningful value. Entrepreneurs should aim to serve their audience first, and in doing so, they achieve their own success.

  - 2024-12-03 | Last month I created the attribution link to test it and sent it to the person who helps me with FBM purchases and reviews. After she completed the purchase, I was able to see the traffic data and received a 10% refund on the referral fees. While my intention was just to test the link, I‚Äôve come to realize that using it for FBM purchases and reviews can help recoup some of the referral fees paid to Amazon. Has anyone else tried this? Are there any risks involved? ü§î

  - 2024-11-30 | Hi Hannah! If your bulk order is ready to ship, you‚Äôll need to create shipping labels to send to the supplier. The shipping labels will include the addresses of the warehouses where the cartons will be delivered.
  - 2024-11-30 | That‚Äôs what I thought too! I didn‚Äôt get to choose the warehouses for my bulk order either. I‚Äôm not sure how we can select specific warehouses to save money.
  - 2024-11-30 | The shipping quote might not be exact, but it should be fairly close to what you'll actually pay once your bulk order is ready to ship.
  - 2024-11-30 | Hey Hannah, you can randomly select any warehouse address to provide to the shipping agent for the shipping quote. If shipping to the West Coast turns out to be the most affordable option, then choose addresses from that region. You won‚Äôt know the specific addresses until you‚Äôre ready to create shipping labels for your supplier.
  - 2024-11-29 | Yes! Usually, if they don‚Äôt want you to use their video on other platforms, they‚Äôll only send a preview version with the word ‚ÄúPREVIEW‚Äù over it to prevent you from using it.
  - 2024-11-29 | If the influencer allows you to download the video freely or doesn‚Äôt mention any copyright restrictions, you can use the video across any platform.
  - 2024-11-29 | Yes you can! I just did that a few days ago.

  - 2024-10-24 | Thanks Han! That's what I'm trying to figure out is how I can determine the next bid according to the recorded data. Is it too new to see the pattern?
  - 2024-10-24 | Is the rule for setting a new bid for ASIN targets different from that for keywords? I've noticed that ASINs with no clicks have had their bids increased by 7 to 10%. If I need to set the new bid manually, how can I determine the appropriate percentage to increase it by?

  - 2024-11-25 | I think I finally figured out how to update the link‚Äîit‚Äôs been a while since I last did that. I copied the link from the new flow, pasted it into the Tiger QR code I‚Äôm using for the insert card, and then turned off the trigger for the old chat flow. Am I doing this correctly?
  - 2024-11-25 | Do I turn off the trigger for the old flow?
  - 2024-11-25 | done
  - 2024-11-25 | I‚Äôve already reached out to ManyChat customer support for help. I‚Äôm unsure what else I can do to resolve the issue.
  - 2024-11-25 | Just happened again
  - 2024-11-25 | how do I change the link to the qrcode?
  - 2024-11-24 | Yes
  - 2024-11-24 | This happened almost everytime someone scan the qr code.

  - 2024-11-24 | Hi <@536075832658231299>,

I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is, but it seems that customers who scan the QR code aren‚Äôt being prompted by ManyChat. The chat flow doesn‚Äôt appear. Could the QR code be the problem? What should I do? ü´§
  - 2024-11-23 | Airtable doesn‚Äôt have a field to enter return costs.
  - 2024-11-23 | thanks

  - 2024-11-21 | Hi <@536075832658231299> ! I‚Äôm unsure where to categorize these costs: promo costs and coupon fees. Also, for replacement orders, do those count as units sold without any sales or additional fees? Additionally, I‚Äôve noticed that some of my referral fees are significantly higher than others, and some orders don‚Äôt have any referral fees at all, even though the sold price is the same. What could be causing this?
  - 2024-11-17 | I still need sometime to work on it.  I will submit it tomorrow.  Thanks for  reminding me, Jamie!
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you Jamie
  - 2024-11-11 | Okay! I'll try that
  - 2024-11-11 | 
  - 2024-11-11 | I tested it again last night and encountered the same issue. I had to upload it twice for ManyChat to acknowledge it.
  - 2024-11-11 | Hi Han! She did click on the button.
  - 2024-11-11 | I'm not sure why this issue keeps occurring with my ManyChat flow. After a customer uploads her screenshot, ManyChat still displays a message saying it hasn't been received. I‚Äôve tested the flow several times, and it seemed to work fine, but this has now happened twice when customers have uploaded their screenshots. Each time, I had to step in, apologize, and confirm that they would receive the gift card by email.
  - 2024-11-03 | thanks
  - 2024-11-03 | okay
  - 2024-11-03 | and then adjust it again when th limited time deal is over?
  - 2024-11-03 | Do I just do a bulk adjustment to all the keywords ?
  - 2024-11-03 | Should I adjust my PPC campaign when a competitor is running a Limited Time Deal? My PPC spend is higher than usual, but I‚Äôm not seeing any sales.
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you, Susan! Yes, I check the market every day to see if a price adjustment is needed. My pricing is slightly better than competitors‚Äô, though I‚Äôve noticed many new sellers undercutting with lower prices. I also spoke with other mentees in the same niche, and it seems we‚Äôre all facing the same issues‚Äîhigh PPC costs and slow sales.

  - 2024-10-28 | I just resubmit for ppc assistant.
  - 2024-10-28 | I just submitted a request for a PPC assistant. Over the last five days, my PPC spend was only $285‚Äîbelow my ACOS‚Äîbut sales have been slow from day one. I‚Äôm not sure if this is just a niche-wide slowdown or is it just my listing is not attracting buyers .

Right now, I‚Äôm working on driving more sales outside of Amazon through influencer marketing and to add additional video content for both my listing and social media. Is there anything else you‚Äôd recommend to help boost sales?

Thanks so much for your advice!
  - 2024-10-17 | I saw this in campaign manager for growth opportunity suggesting I could drive an estimated $2,115 in sales for my product due to increased organic clicks.  Would you recommend participating in something like this? <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>

  - 2024-12-05 | From my experience with returning products to Amazon, they‚Äôve always made the process very easy. Typically, they give customers 30 days to initiate a return or exchange. However, as long as you request the return within that 30-day window, they still accept the product even if you send it back after the 30 days have passed. With this new policy, it seems like Amazon is becoming more strict on returns, as they only pay us after the sale is finalized. Just my thought! üòÖ
  - 2024-12-05 | This could actually be a positive change for sellers because, with this new policy, Amazon is likely enforcing a stricter return policy, meaning customers won‚Äôt be able to return items after 30 or 45 days. If we offer high-quality products that match what‚Äôs promised in our listings and meet customer expectations, this policy could work in our favor as sellers. Just my thoughts!
  - 2024-12-05 | Thanks, Tara!
  - 2024-12-05 | Thanks, Han! Yes, I‚Äôm still working on getting more influencer review videos out there to boost exposure. However, I‚Äôve noticed that shoppable videos no longer seem to show up on competitor listings. Now, I only see videos posted directly by the sellers, which is a bit of a bummer. That said, I completely agree that having as much video content as possible is super valuable for driving conversions!
  - 2024-12-05 | I already have the full 5 shoppable video slots in the top carousel of my listing. If I add another video, Amazon might either swap one of the current videos to the bottom carousel or place the new one there. My question is: is the bottom carousel reliable in the sense that it will always appear whenever a customer visits the listing?

If I remember correctly, shoppable videos used to show up on competitor listings as related products, but I haven‚Äôt seen that happen recently. Does anyone have experience with this or know how it works now?
  - 2024-11-30 | Yes! It's similar to a regular link to your listing. However, if you post it on social media or share it with an influencer, you can track the traffic and conversion rate for each link in seller central advertisement page.
  - 2024-11-30 | I'm not sure how to create an attribution link for each variation. I only know how to create an attribution link that directs buyers to your main listing. It's quite simple. Just go to your Campaign Manager, click on "Measurement and Reporting" on the left side, and select "Amazon Attribution." From there, click on "Create Campaign," choose "Create Manually," and follow the instructions to set up your attribution link.

  - 2024-11-15 | Hey everyone! I just wanted to share an idea that might help you drive more sale. With Black Friday and the holiday season coming up, I decided to update my main listing image with a holiday or Christmas-themed background to make it stand out more in search results. I think this could help increase clicks and sales!
Here‚Äôs how I did it using Canva:
1.  Click Create a Design.
2.  Search for ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù and select Amazon product image 1080 x 1080 px.
3.  Upload your main image from your listing.
4.  Click on the image to add it to the design.
5.  Select the image and click Edit.
6.  Tap on BG Remover on the left to remove the image background.
7.  Click on Elements on the left and search for something like ‚ÄúChristmas present background,‚Äù ‚Äúholiday background,‚Äù or ‚ÄúChristmas border‚Äù to see festive options.
8.  Tap on the background you want to use, and it will appear in the design.
9.  While the background is still selected, click Edit and tap BG Remover to make it white (this is required by Amazon for main images).
10.  Stretch the background to fit the design size and adjust it until you like the look.
11.  While the background is still selected, click Position.
12.  Tap Go Back to place the background behind your main image. This ensures your product stays on top and visible.
13. Adjust the image size and position as needed.
14.  Tap Share and then Download.
15.  Save the file as a PNG.
And voil√†! You‚Äôre ready to upload this festive main image to your listing. Feel free to get creative with other holiday backgrounds; backgrounds with borders tend to work best!
  - 2024-11-08 | Hey everyone! I just discovered a feature on Seller Central that can benefit us all. If you have a social media page for your product, you can set up an Amazon Attribution campaign to track traffic coming from your page, ads, or even specific influencers.

Here's how it works: the campaign generates a special link you can share on your product page, social media, or with influencers. This link lets you see how much traffic each source is driving, so you can measure the effectiveness of influencer marketing and other external channels.

The best part? It‚Äôs FREE to use, and Amazon will reward you with a 10% bonus on every sale made through these links. Even better, these sales are considered organic, which can help boost your product‚Äôs ranking. The 10% bonus is applied as a reduction on your referral fees two months after the sale.

Learn more about the Brand Referral Bonus program here: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/brand-referral-bonus

  - 2024-11-03 | Is anyone else having issues with advertising data not showing up?
  - 2024-11-03 | Cool! I'll look into it.
  - 2024-11-02 | learned something new!
  - 2024-11-02 | I was thinking about running a limited time deal, but Amazon doesn't let me do it because of their restriction. <@931213533134344222>  and I was just chatting about it. lol

My strategy so far has been using TikTok for product ideas then hopping on AMZ and using Helium to see if it's a viable product and updating my product tracking sheet. Let me know  if you see a way to improve things.
  - 2024-11-03 | Hi brother! As you know, I am still in the product research phase. The last few weeks have been challenging but I am praying and staying positive. During the last few weeks I have finalized my divorce and my priority has been my 5 year old son Alex. I have finally found an apartment and some stability for him and me. The divorce has not been easy on my son and he has had a lot of behavioral issues which we are seeing a counselor for.  Right now is the most stability I have had in over 1 year. I know I haven't been able to stay consistent in this program. Raniel is my accountability partner and Olesia has been a HUGE help. All this is to say that I have struggled. I'm not looking for sympathy, ultimately, I need to be more accountable and  I have no one to blame but myself.  Life is not easy and everyone has some form of issues related to health/life/children. It is a part of life. Having said all of this, I promise you I will hold myself to higher standards and be more accountable and submit homework on a regular basis going forward. Please write me up next time I don't submit a homework.
  - 2024-10-21 | <@1266755529984835626>  and I are partnering up as accountability partners.

That is why Amazon always suggests that sellers begin holiday inventory prep as early as summer to avoid late shipping bottlenecks and your inventory should be in stock before October. For future holiday seasons, one of the best ways to avoid similar situations is to plan your shipments well ahead of time

  - 2024-12-05 | Hi sis
Once your brand is approved, you typically don't need to do anything extra to ensure the product is listed under your brand. Double-check the "Brand" field when adding the new listing, and that should ensure it's associated with your brand.

  - 2024-11-26 | The freight forwarder often has more favorable shipping rates because they are experienced in logistics and long-term contracts with carriers
  - 2024-11-26 | From my experience, I suggest you compare the shipping costs between your supplier and the freight forwarder.
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi David
  - 2024-11-15 | This is the shipping label brother, sorry I am confused. Are you talking about the shipping label (apply on the carton for shipping to Amazon warehouse) or the item label (apply on the box)?
  - 2024-11-15 | you can click on "print item label" from FBA listing
  - 2024-11-15 | can you capture the manage listings please?
  - 2024-11-15 | I think  maybe they are asking about the shipping label
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | You can do both FBM and FBA on the same ASIN
On your FBM listing, select "Add another condition" and set it up as FBA. This will create a new FBA listing for the same ASIN with a new SKU
  - 2024-11-15 | I think you printed the item label from FBM listing
  - 2024-11-15 | May I ask do you create FBA listing?

  - 2024-11-09 | Hi everyone! excited to meet you all!!  I am Charmine Di Turi. I am currently 28 years old and just moved to the US 5 months ago. I am working in the hospitality industry. I am starting my Amazon Shifu mentorship journey today, November 9th, and I will succeed in this. Succeeding in this program means that I am able to make money passively, not live paycheck to paycheck, make myself proud, but most importantly pay it forward. I am excited to be a part of this community as I've seen the impact this program has given a lot of people- not just financially but their overall mindset in life. 1% greater everyday. I am so motivated to succeed because I believe I am in a place to help others and change lives. May not be many but I definitely want to create a greater impact. I am doing this for myself, my future children, my husband, those in need. I want to show them that hard-work pays off and life is meant to be enjoyed. We should be our own bosses and live our lives in our own terms. I want to be able to start a family and to travel. I do not want to be where I'm at- working 12-14 hour days and having only a day a week to spend with my husband. I want to be in control of my time. In the future, when I‚Äôm successful- I want to tell myself that Hard-work pays off and anything is possible. When encountering difficulty I will remind myself that:  Struggling is normal. If I give up now- I will be in the same situation for the rest of my life.  https://youtu.be/kwX118LM8vE

  - 2024-02-24 | I guess when the demand increase, they will increase their price too. Or maybe because we use them to open the LLC, so they can have a different price for us?! But im sure they know how to make money.

  - 2024-11-01 | Same for me‚Ä¶. Have been waiting for 20 min. Maybe I misunderstood the time or day?

  - 2024-12-05 | thanks Chloe üôÇ Ok, so I guess that is necessary? That we need to order and pay for a external product ID no matter what kind of product it is?
  - 2024-12-04 | Finally got my Amazon seller account for America approved! üôÇ  So I started with a dummy listing since Ive been waiting to do that. But, I dont understand where to find the "External Product ID" and the "External Product ID Type". Attached a printscreen to be more specific.
  - 2024-11-25 | Hi! Maybe this is a stupid question... But, how do I know the cost of the shipping for my profit calculation? Since I dont know what FBA-destination Amazon will choose for me yet... I need to list my product before I get info about what FBA-adress my products be shipped  to, right?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Jamie! Im fine thanks, hope u are too... Still waiting for my first samples to arrive, excited about that. My biggest challenge right now is to get my supplier to apply all my requested changes on the product. Find the right packaging, and I find it hard to know exactly what to do and to do things in the right order. But ill get there...
  - 2024-11-15 | Do you think its ok even tho its in the baby-category?  if yes, ill start contacting suppliers and work on my profit-calculation. If you dont recommend to go with that product because of the "catagory" I have another ont that might be a potential product.
  - 2024-11-15 | The product that was "ok" is this one https://www.amazon.com/s?k=baby%20lounger%20nest%20portable&ref=glow_cls&refresh=1
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you <@1054411267340763216> for being so helpful and for all your patience
  - 2024-11-11 | Ok, thank you <@1054411267340763216>  ! That was my guess too, but I find the product super interesting since it‚Äôs the NO 1 baby product in Scandinavia. It‚Äôs a genius product. Too bad it‚Äôs not that big in the US yet. Thanks for your good advice as always üôèü´∂
  - 2024-11-11 | Here it is üôÇ
  - 2024-11-10 | H i again!Sorry for bothering with all these question... But the reason I dont want to ask this one officially is because its about a very spceial product that I would like to keep secret until I know how to deal with it. Hope its ok. 
In Sweden there is a product called "vibrating stroller rocket". Its universal for all baby strollers and puts the baby to sleep. Its a VERY popular product in Sweden. So I did some PR on Amazon and I noticed that this product isnt really big yet in the US. There is a couple of sellers making ok profit.  Is this a "dangerous" product to work with or how come the number of sellers are so few? Also a product I should stay away from? Or do you think I can go deeper with the anlysis? 

Heres the product https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHFDJ6P9?psc=1
  - 2024-11-09 | Ok, got it! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks Han! ‚≠êÔ∏èüôè
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi guys! Hope u are fine ‚ò∫Ô∏è just a quick question about my PR since I needed to cancel my product ‚Äúcordless table lamp rechargeable‚Äù. Is it just that kind of model that is on your black list? Or is it lightning over all? Would you recommend me to stay away from all kind of lamps?
  - 2024-10-28 | 
  - 2024-10-28 | Ah, I just saw that the class tomorrow is at 2 am in the morning for me. üòï  So I will not be able to attend. But I can attend the class at Friday if there is any?
  - 2024-10-28 | If i want to to bring a product up in the meeting for analyse, do I need to send any form to you before the class? üôÇ
  - 2024-10-26 | Perfect, thank you so much for that! What do I need to prepare for that class? üôÇ
  - 2024-10-26 | For me, the schedule looks like this with my timezone.

But since the class with you <@1054411267340763216> at wednesdays are at 3 am in the morning for me, I havent been able to join and bring them up for feedback in the class. Can i bring it up at another class? The one on thursdays, mondays or saturdays? These ones are more easy for me to attend because of the timezone... Or will that be the wrong forum for this?
  - 2024-10-21 | Thanks <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out... Really appreciate! Been feeling kind of lonely the past week. Its so hard to keep up with the classes since im in a different time zone. Even tho I watch the recordings I feel like Im behind since I dint get the same chance to participate live and ask questions... But I do my best! üôÇ 

Last week I leared how to use the PR-tracking sheet and I tried a lot of different tools in Helium10. Not sure how good my draft is but there is 7 products in my tracking sheet right now that Ive been practicing to analyze.  I try to find one product for each day. to analyze and find an opportunity with.
  - 2024-10-11 | I've been focused on taking care of all the formalities for the last two days as I couldn't sign up for an Amazon account without having a company specifically dedicated to this in Sweden. My accountant has helped me set this up, and it will take three business days after we applied for approval from the government yesterday. It's a bit of a longer startup process for me since I need to follow Swedish regulations, and it will cost me about 3,000 USD extra.  (good to know if there will be any other students from Sweden in the future) By Tuesday at the latest, all the paperwork should be done, and my company will be up and running, which means I can sign up for an Amazon Seller account then. In the meantime, I‚Äôve done as much product research as I can üôÇ Do you recommend me to attend class tomorrow anyway? Or should I keep doing the product research instead?
  - 2024-10-10 | Wonderful, thanks üôÇ
  - 2024-11-01 | Yes, we have matched up. Me and <@772970575144288288>  üôÇ
  - 2024-10-22 | Perfect! <@772970575144288288>
  - 2024-10-21 | My location is Sweden and my timezone is  GMT+2, my strengths is my energy and 
willingness to learn. Im a "protoganist" in the personality test üôÇ

  - 2024-11-18 | Team - update on Long as I would like to close the loop, due to personal matters he will be unable to rejoin the program, I will continue to stay in touch and check in on him and his family every so often but do take a moment to pray for him and his family as they are going through some difficult times. I have updated his account accordingly and left a note there as well.
  - 2024-10-10 | <@536075832658231299> <@1054411267340763216> <@1066465177140215928> 
All - I would like to provide an update regarding <@1263229562142330913>who is currently under financial distress due to unexpected personal circumstances. I met with him tonight to discuss the status of his membership and we've decided to put him on pause as he wish to remain in the program. I have a follow-up meeting to check-in with him regarding his situation and reassess his status a month from now on Wed 11/6. I've informed him to reach out to us through this dedicated private channel if his situation improves and we can resume active support for him.

<@1263229562142330913> We will be praying for you brother and please do not hesitate to reach out to our team through this chat if you need anything. Please keep us updated, will check up on you and your family in a month.

  - 2024-11-26 | Happy Thanksgiving this week everyone üôÇ
  - 2024-11-26 | That is absolutely OK, just wanted to make sure we get something established as we're looking to grow the list of volunteers / ambassadors to support the community
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi <@308107877493768193> , I'm sure it's been hectic with Thanksgiving comning up, I have a request that needs your support, Justing would like for us to create a daily SOP for Volunteers/Ambassadors like yourself that oultines the benefits and minimum expectations. Here are the benefits as long as they are an active volunteer or ambassador:

1 - Unlimited access to active support
2 - Free access to advanced modules
3 - Early access to networking and mastermind events, registration fees waived
4 - As needed, 1-1 coaching with any delivery team members

Minimum Expectations:
1 - Support Q&A Channels (active-support-qa & private channels)
2 - Encourage community engagement
3 - Help redirect questions to coaches and private channels
4 - Help review and provide vault content feedback
5 - Support CSM activities and small projects (e.g. Daily SOPs, KBRs, etc.)

Is this something you can help me get started using a similar template?
  - 2024-11-15 | Jamie can help coordinate the effort within the team and you can continue to provide feedback
  - 2024-11-15 | <@308107877493768193> This looks good, I think we need to start assigning owners within the team to help take your feedback and make the updates, can you add a priority colunn of High, Medium, Low? I think that'll help give us an idea on what updates are truly important or urgent, if it's a minor thing but a nice to have update, I would mark those as Low
  - 2024-11-07 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-07 | Just wanted to give you a heads up and some background
  - 2024-11-07 | I would wait for her to reach out
  - 2024-11-07 | @everyone Team - please make note of her goals, I will let you know if her payment clears and is officially extended
  - 2024-11-07 | I would hate for her to pull back as her membership officially expires in 10 days or so with the progress she has made thus far
  - 2024-11-07 | I am sending her a payment link, she's committed and only has good things to say about the team and program, please help encourage her extension, we will take care of her
  - 2024-11-07 | <@308107877493768193> Heads-up, I had a retention / extension call with Carolina Chu, she agrees to pay the extension with the Continuation offer, it's $2k for 6 months + one bonus month so a total of 7 months, her first milestone is to hit $1k profit in 6 months and $2-3k profit over the next 12 months, so it's totally realistic and feasible for us to help her hit those goals and even exceed them, but she wanted to talk to you about her progress as she has a close connection with you from the beginning
  - 2024-11-06 | No worries brother, it's been a crazy past week for most, just wanted to check-in
  - 2024-11-06 | Hi <@308107877493768193>, how is the course content assessment coming along? Anything you need from us at the moment?
  - 2024-10-30 | <@1059659092475531444> FYI - Met with Louis, he'll be helping out with content management and will perform an audit on what is out-dated or needs improving, he'll reach out for your support to divide and conquer once he puts together a plan
  - 2024-10-30 | <@308107877493768193> Looks good, I just sent it over to Justin, thanks!
  - 2024-10-30 | <@308107877493768193> Would you be able to create a version of the Daily SOP for distribution? Removing the version control and etc? That way we can upload the document in the vault for people to download...
  - 2024-10-30 | Appreciate that <@308107877493768193> it was brought to our attention, let's make sure he's taken cared of
  - 2024-10-29 | Thanks <@308107877493768193> sent you an invite for 12:30pm PST, hope that's ok
  - 2024-10-28 | <@308107877493768193> thanks! What‚Äôs a good time Wednesday and I‚Äôll check my calendar
  - 2024-10-28 | <@308107877493768193> what is your schedule like this week? Would like to meet and get your input on some offers that are being developed‚Ä¶
  - 2024-10-28 | Ok thanks, let me know if you're limited on Loom, we can work on getting you a paid account
  - 2024-10-28 | <@308107877493768193> Do you use Loom? Would you be able to create a video that walks through the Daily SOP and how to implement it? We can send the recording over to Justin and he can decide whether to re-record it in his voice or end up using your video, let me know if there are any concerns or questions
  - 2024-10-24 | @everyone FYI - I've created the "my-daily-top2s" channel in the general community but only moderators and admins can see it now, when ready we'll add the general and premium members to it for visibility but it's there now
  - 2024-10-24 | Module 1 - Part 2 is Product Analysis so that covers the analysis sheet prepation as the entire module covers all of that and how to request a review
  - 2024-10-24 | The lesson is titled "Product Research Tracker tool"
  - 2024-10-24 | <@308107877493768193> We have separate modules regarding the product tracking sheet but they all should be in the Product Research module
  - 2024-10-23 | We can do a final review before we go live with everything
  - 2024-10-23 | Yes it‚Äôll be under product research module
  - 2024-11-08 | <@613172337470341150> I forgot to mention, as part of your extension you are eligible for "emergency" sessions as needed during the entire duration of 7 months using the booking link above to book 1-1 with any of the coaches, for your launch support lean on Han and Susan

  - 2024-10-26 | @everyone I just met with Jose, he's committed but going through some challenges with a demanding work schedule (10-14 hours a day, multiple facilities), his schedule should stabilize within a month, so in the meantime we agree to the following so that he can continue to make some progress (1% a day) to maintain some momentum:

1) <@1054411267340763216> will follow-up with Jose to check-in with him once a week to make sure he is maintaining some degree of progress - no need to keep following up regarding homework and assignments until Jose schedule stabilizes
2) <@1218639416277467216> committed to consume the content in the vault, take notes and implement what he can, his focus will be to take some action in making progress with Product Research & Analysis
3) <@1218639416277467216> will not be able to attend classes due to his schedule being unpredictable, but he will leverage this dedicated private channel for questions as he reviews the content

<@1054411267340763216> Please give Jose some breathing room, he is committed to taking small actions every week to move forward, when he becomes more stable with his job's schedule, we'll ramp up and help him catch up

<@1218639416277467216> We're here to support you but we'll need you to keep us updated on your progress when Minh checks in on you, stay strong brother and do your best to stay engaged
  - 2024-10-30 | @everyone Team - Please welcome Aimy back, she is re-engaged after our conversation and is determined to build her Amazon business üí™ She is currently pursuing her real estate license in FL but is committed to the program. We will re-evaluate her membership in 6 months but let's make sure she hit her goals and find a product!

<@1054411267340763216> Aimy will book a welcome call with you to re-orient herself as the program changed significantly since she last got involved, let's follow the process and get her familiar with the new program structure, class schedule, homework, and etc.

<@701516410769375303> Let's stay committed, I want to see you post wins in the next few months üôÇ. Leverage the team as much as possible and use this private channel for support. Again, welcome back! Be sure to go through WEEK 1 modules, you got this!
  - 2024-11-01 | @everyone Team - please welcome back Anthony to active support, he had an amazing first launch and sold nearly $60k in sales back in April and had to spend 2 months to get it re-launched but the results were not the same, let‚Äôs continue to support him for the next 6 months to close the gap and get him stabilized.

<@296142820849221633> We‚Äôll revisit your active support in 6 months and discuss your options then, but let‚Äôs get you stabilized and profitable in the meantime, please book your launching call with Han ASAP, here is the booking link:
