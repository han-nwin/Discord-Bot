  - 2025-02-05 | Welcome to the team ! Wahoo, another mentee from CA !
  - 2025-02-04 | Thank you !
  - 2025-02-04 | Welcome aboard! We‚Äôre thrilled To have you apart of the team !
  - 2025-02-04 | Excited to see where your journey takes you on the road ! Let‚Äôs continue to grow !
  - 2025-02-04 | Let‚Äôs start this journey strong and determined! üí™
  - 2025-02-04 | Welcome aboard! I‚Äôm also new so let‚Äôs start this journey strong !
  - 2025-02-04 | Welcome to the shifu community!
  - 2025-02-04 | Hi, I‚Äôm Matheson, a 25-year-old Diesel Technician from Fresno, CA. Outside of work, I‚Äôm passionate about gaming, traveling, hiking, working out, and spending quality time with my family.The main reason I joined this mentorship program is because of Shifu Justin's inspiring story about retiring his mom and giving her a life she may have never imagined. That‚Äôs something I  want to do for my mom as well. I believe that with Shifu's expert guidance, structured learning, networking opportunities, and valuable resources, I‚Äôll be able to create a successful Amazon business and take my life to the next level.Over the next 1-2 years, my primary goal is to master the strategies and key takeaways that will help me grow my business. Eventually, I want to have it running on autopilot. Looking ahead, I envision myself as a successful entrepreneur, financially free, self-employed, with a house of my own, and starting a family. When I face challenges, I remind myself that the risks I‚Äôm taking now are for my future‚Äîboth for myself and my future children, building generational wealth along the way. When I achieve success, I‚Äôll tell myself: ‚ÄúI overcame every challenge because I believed in my vision of becoming my own boss and creating something meaningful. Every obstacle was a stepping stone, and I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come. I made it‚Äînow let‚Äôs keep reaching for the stars!‚Äù

  - 2025-02-05 | Hi everyone, I am Jessica Ly, 36yrs , from South CA. I am  currently working as a property management short term rental and nail technician also 
Being tired when I work 2 jobs at the same time and not enough time for enjoying myself and spend time with my mom either, so I decide to change something new with Shifu Team that helping me build my own business in the future 
My main goal is to keep getting better at what I do‚Äîand be successful with my business as increasing selling, get more passive income and I can quit my current job to focus on my own Amazon business. 
I am staying true to my purpose and embraced every opportunity to make a positive impact. The challenges I face only make me stronger and more resilient. When I look back , I will celebrate the progress I have made and the difference I have created and let continue to be better, to learn more and to provide grater value 
I would tell myself ‚ÄúI understand that every difficulty is a learning opportunity so I will reflect on what I went wrong and how I can improve next time ‚Äú

  - 2025-01-07 | Congratulations Olesia! You‚Äôre awesome! üëè
  - 2024-12-18 | I too won‚Äôt be able to attend. We have family plans. You guys have a good time! Hopefully I can attend next year
  - 2025-01-17 | Thank you so much Jamie! I am hoping to get everything balanced out sooner but wanted to note mid-April just in case. Please do help me pray for peace, guidance and clarity. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
  - 2025-01-17 | Hello Jamie - I hope you had a great holiday season. I wanted to touch base as the past month has been overwhelming with work and personal commitments. I haven‚Äôt been able to fully refocus on AMZ Shifu as much as I would like. It hurts me to have to make this request but I am reaching out to see if it would it be possible for me to take a break until mid-April to get things back on track? Our manager resigned, and with the company acquiring three new businesses, our team has taken on extra responsibilities and have been working long hours. On top of that, my personal life has been quite busy, leaving me with little mental space. Once we have a new manager, my workload should balance out. Please let me know if this can be arranged. Thank you for understanding. I hope to return with a clearer mind and more time to focus on my AMZ business so that I can get myself out of the 9-5pm.
  - 2024-12-11 | Hi Jamie - thank you for checking in. I‚Äôm moving slower than planned but am moving along. I‚Äôm working at the moment and am trying to knock out most of my work so that I can attend class later. I have blocked out 4-5pm to go through module 2. I appreciate you following up. Enjoy the rest of your day. ü§ó
  - 2024-12-05 | Hey there <@1059659092475531444>! thank you for checking in. I‚Äôm going through Module 2, jotting notes and creating my checklist on next steps. I was sick last week and started feeling a bit better this week. Hope to get through Module 2 by end of week and start my profit calculation and reach out to suppliers
  - 2024-11-22 | Will do! Thanks Minh!!
  - 2024-11-20 | Hello - do I start attending today‚Äôs class? Or should I finish Module 2 first?
  - 2024-11-20 | Thanks <@1054411267340763216>! hope you feel better. Have a nice day!
  - 2024-11-15 | Thanks, Minh! I‚Äôve been behind with my PR. Our oldest caught strep throat last week then we had a family engagement party to attend.  I‚Äôve also been going through some personal stuff and have been mentally scattered. Personal life is starting to go back to normal schedule so I‚Äôm slowly back at it. I am aiming to submit 3 product analysis to you by 11/22. I really appreciate you putting the time out for the Friday class. See you next week. Have a great weekend!
  - 2024-10-28 | Is that a good increase in 3 days?
  - 2024-10-28 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> - Happy Monday! I reran Helium 10 and the revenue went up by a little over 8k since 10/24.
  - 2024-10-28 | 
  - 2024-10-25 | I will check on it again on Monday and will update you. I will also continue to look for more products üòÅ
  - 2024-10-25 | Thank you so much Minh for your input! It is such a great feeling to hear ‚Äúokay, I like this market‚Äù!! üôåüôè

  - 2025-01-29 | Hi <@300413896479604737>, i asked both my suppliers and Macy‚Äôs agency to provide me with quotes for my goods to be shipped to 5 different warehouses directed by Amazon seller central like the video ‚ÄúCreate FBA Shipment New Update Shifu Han‚Äù in Shipping Module. Then i compare the two prices and negotiate between Macy and my supplier to see if I can get a price match before moving on.
  - 2025-02-19 | Thank you!!
  - 2025-02-19 | Hey guys, my products are arriving to the warehouse a bit later than i expected. How do we change the Delivery window on Seller Central? Thanks guys!
  - 2025-01-23 | For Q&A sections with customers, I'm trying to upload a video on how to use my product to my customer in Buyer Messages but Seller Central would not allow me to. Is there specific format that the video has to be in? Thanks!
  - 2025-01-19 | Thanks <@1167106129415909496> just figured that out haha
  - 2025-01-19 | Hi, for some reason, my FBM listing price (supposed to be priced at $129.99) is now the same as my FBA listing price ($99.99). I went into ‚ÄúEdit Listing‚Äù but had not figured out why. The price listed for the FBM listing is still $129.99 on the seller side, but is shown as $99.99 for the customers. Has anyone run into this problem before? Thanks

  - 2025-02-12 | Stupid question y'all: how do you figure out the initial bids for your keywords in the manual keywords? I remember we just do "Suggested bid" initially right? Thanks
  - 2025-02-04 | Hi Justin, thank you for your answer. To clarify, I did answer all of the questions via Message in my Inbox since that is where all the questions go  when the customer clicked on the "Post your question" box here. Maybe Amazon changed up the Q&A section? However, on my competitor's listing, I still see Q&A posted just in January 2025. Any other suggestion?
  - 2025-02-04 | 
  - 2025-02-04 | Q&A section for product listing: Hey guys, <@1168356026471436323> and a couple other people have been trying to help me with the Q&A section for my listing. However, when Chloe sent me a question, it went straight into my Message Inbox as a private message from the customer. So when I answered it, the answer stayed in the Inbox instead of populating itself on the Q&A section. Has anybody run into the same situation as we are right now? Chloe said it was not like this before and when a customer asks a question on the listing, Amazon supposed to send us an email to answer it instead. I got the email from Amazon but it direct me to my Inbox instead. Thank you in advance!
  - 2025-02-03 | Gotcha! Would you recommend having it for the first launch based on your experience?

  - 2025-02-12 | Hi Shifu Team, hope you guys are doing fantastic! It's been a while since I last reach out for an update on my progress. Here are the things that I have set up and ready for launch:

1. Listing:
- Awaiting Listing Creation, Brand Story, and Unboxing and Product Introduction Videos from Susan
- 8 Q&As posted with videos showing instruction of use
- 10 F&F Reviews done with 7 of them having videos and pictures
- Premium A+ Content approved by Seller Central. Awaiting Listing Creation for Susan.
- Manychat flow: done

2. PPC: 
- I watched all the videos and noted everything down in a personal notes so I can refer to.
- PPC practice: I did 2 out of 4 PPC homework Han posted  on Discord. Will continue to work on them gradual to refine my skill.
- Keyword research: Done. Had a list of 10-15 main keywords and 10-15 longtail keywords.
- ASIN Research: Done. have 20 ASINs that I think I can compete against to win customers over.

3. Social Media: 
- Averaging 2-3 posts per week to educate followers

Questions:
1. Listing: Should I have at least 1 UGC video of a person reviewing my product? If so can I have access to the UGC module so I can learn about UGC appropriately? 
2. PPC: What else can I do in the mean time for PPC?
3. Social Media: Any recomendation as well for more engagement on Social Media?

Thank you guys so much! üôè
  - 2024-12-17 | Got it! Thanks Jamie!
  - 2024-12-17 | <@1066465177140215928> Hi ch·ªã Susan, hope you are doing well! I'm reaching out because I am very much interested with your Listing Creation Package ONE and Product Features Video. Could you let me know how many units would you like me to send you? Thanks ch·ªã!
  - 2024-12-17 | Also, i talked to David and he said you sent him a very good contact for inspection. Could I please have the same contact as well? Thank you!
  - 2024-12-17 | Hi Jamie, I‚Äôm doing well! I got 80% of all my data down for the product: Trademark, Brand registry, Bare-bone listing, Packaging design, Manual redesign, and Manychat are done. 

I‚Äôm working with a Fiverr designer for my insert card and that should be done by today. Tonight, I‚Äôm going to discuss more with my supplier to get all the pricing in paper so I can start drafting the bulk order contract. I booked a call with Minh tomorrow to go over everything the last time before ordering the bulk order. Is there anything else would you add onto my list of work so far to better expedite the process?
  - 2024-12-05 | Thank you Jamie for looking out for me! üôå I‚Äôll definitely reach out when questions arise!
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi brother Jamie, thank you for reaching out üòÅ

Here are a couple updates from me today:

1. Trademark: the brandname search continued to be a challenge for me even though i vetted USPTO and Google prior to submitting them to my attorney. But my attorney seems to always be able to find a registered brand with similar name that can have USPTO to potentially block my application. Solution: I‚Äôm seeking help from a couple gigs on Fiverr that do brand name search for me for cheaper prices ($10-$30/name). if i have better odd, I‚Äôll file trademark with the brand name right away. 

2. Digital add-on product: i‚Äôm finishing up the add-on digital ebook for my customers to get reviews from them

3. Finalizing add-ons: i just finalized add-ons for my main product as well. My suppliers are sending the addon over for me to take a look at. I have 3 suppliers for this product. One of them communicate better than the other two so i will likely go with him and keep the other 2 as reserve
  - 2024-10-28 | Another issue when it comes to starting all over again is that I have already submitted my trademark application ü•≤ This is the most costly thing I have done so far and trying to find a new product to fit under this name brand would also be a challenge.
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you <@536075832658231299> for your advice! I appreciate it!  I can see the risk of having just one supplier for your product. If anything goes wrong, I won‚Äôt be having a backup supplier.

<@975774205658411068> Hey shifu, would you be able to provide me with your thoughts on my situation? If both of you and Han lean toward the latter, I will drop the product. 

Thank you for all your help
  - 2024-10-28 | (2) Sourcing Agents: I have reached out to Macy and Elinor last week to help me source a product that has FDA 501k clearance. Thus far, Macy has not been able to locate a supplier that can offer better deal that the one I have right now. Furthermore, Macy said no other supplier can provide similar product with the FDA 501k clearance as it is difficult to obtain the certification from the FDA.

My questions are:

1. Should I move forward with this product and order the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier?
2. If ‚Äúno‚Äù is the answer to the first question, what would be recommended for the next step? Should I move away from this product? 

Thank you for all your help! I hope to hear from you soon!
  - 2024-10-28 | Hi Shifu team,

I hope you all had a great weekend! üòÜ

I‚Äôm sending out this message to update you on my listing issue prior to placing a bulk order. I‚Äôm asking for advices on if I should go ahead and purchase the FDA 501(k) clearance from our supplier so I can test out the listing?

Recap: My product is an ‚ÄúAbdominal Electrical Muscle Stimulator Belt‚Äù that requires an FDA 501(k) certification to seller in the US and on Amazon. I have done extensive research on this matter and confirmed that I will need the FDA 501(k) in order to sell this product to the public as Amazon has categorized this product as a medical device. Up to now, I have resolved all the other problems on the dummy listing except for submitting the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier to Seller Support Central

(1) Negotiation with supplier for FDA 501(k) certification: In the beginning,  my suppler wanted 50% down payment of the bulk order in order for me to obtain the FDA 501(k) clearance number to test out my listing. After a few days of negotiation, I was able to bring the price down to 30% down payment for the bulk order (which is roughly $2,500), and the supplier will not take anything less than that for the FDA 501k number. Note: This supplier owns the pattern of a product that has been selling on Amazon by another Chinese seller, and the supplier has assured me that the other Chinese seller was able to submit the same FDA 501(k) clearance number and they are currently selling the product on Amazon.
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you so much <@1054411267340763216> <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you and have a blessed day!
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi Shifu team, would anyone be able to share the sourcing agent Macy that Shifu Justin talked about? I would like to see if they can help me with sourcing out a product! üôè
  - 2024-10-21 | I did. I‚Äôll continue to follow up with them daily
  - 2024-10-21 | In your experience, would it be worth it to continue with this product since they require a lot of paper work and certification? Thanks
  - 2024-10-21 | UPDATE: The new listing became inactive right when I submitted it. I‚Äôm reading up on the regulation on the FDA regarding Electrical Muscle Stimulator. They said that this device will require 501k certification from FDA. I will have to wait for Amazon to response and then will go from there.
  - 2024-10-21 | I will try to create another listing without using any sensitive wording again to see how it goes.
  - 2024-10-21 | Yes, I did try to stay away from sensitive wording and my dummy listing has been approved for over 4-6 weeks, but just 2 days ago, Amazon Seller Central just made my listing inactive. I talked to my supplier about this issue and how one of my competitor was able to have the listing posted since they had the same model as my product. She said they were approved as they submitted further clarification paperwork and also the 501K FDA certification fromthe supplier.
  - 2024-10-19 | Here is my product: EMS belt and arm bands
  - 2024-10-19 | They said my product is for medical professional use only. But not for the public. I believe that is not true that i was able to purchase them myself. Nevertheless, i have submitted an appeal with picture of the packaging and the manual as stated in here. However, my supplier would only send me their 501k number from the FDA for their product once I placed a bulk order, and every supplier has said the same thing to me. I will wait for Amazon to respond then negotiate with my supplier that i want to order from them but it‚Äôs unreasonable to place a bulk order since i cant even sell it on amazon. I‚Äôm considering offering to put down a 3-5% deposit as good faith for the 501k number from the FDA. Would you think this approach is appropriate? <@536075832658231299> thanks for helping!
  - 2024-10-19 | Actually nevermind, all of my dummy listings have gone inactive. I‚Äôll chat further with Amazon to see how I can have it resolved. Would you recommend going with services on Fiverr to help resolve this problem? Thanks
  - 2024-10-19 | Hi anh <@1054411267340763216> thank you for answering my question about the UPC code vs the FNSKU on the dummy listing. Even after I use the service on Fiverr to convert the dummy listing to the real listing, would Amazon potentially flag me for having the product still in the restricted category? üò¨
  - 2024-10-17 | I'm on it üòÑ
  - 2024-10-17 | And just now 1 hour later Amazon approved my brand ü•≥
  - 2024-10-17 | Quick update: My supplier finished the logo-embedded product early. Just submitted Brand Registry application! ‚úÖüôåüôå
  - 2024-10-15 | Such a productive call! Thank you Anh Minh! üôå
  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks anh Minh! Booked a session for tomorrow! üôå
  - 2024-10-13 | While I was waiting for the ball to roll, I have finished the following:
- Two customized manuals for my main product and my add-on product ‚úÖ
- Insert card ‚úÖ
- 2 E-books as free gift for customers to leave review! ‚úÖ
- Instagram and Facebook page for my brand ‚úÖ
- Website Domain ‚úÖ
- Facebook Many Chat Flow to ask for reviews ‚úÖ maybe I need to do one for IG as well since many of my friends are more active on IG? 

What other suggestions would the team recommend? 

I couldn‚Äôt thank you enough for the great content and support for the past two months. I learned a lot and still have a long way to go üôå
I owe you guys each a bowl of Pho when you come to San Jose hehe ü•≥
  - 2024-10-13 | My to do list:
- Brand Registry: By the end of next week or the beginning of the week after that, I should be able to do brand registry. I will rewatch the videos in this module to refresh my knowledge. 
- Final Pricing Sheet with Supplier: I‚Äôm currently working this as well as trying to as for further discount as everything is set in place for now. 
- Barebones Listing: After Brand Registry is done, I will work on Barebones Listing to grab the FNSKU code you place it on the final packaging box. 
- Schedule a call with anh <@1054411267340763216> to go over the details (the market, my offers, pricing sheet, the contract with my supplier) before I place a bulk order. 
- Listing Creation: after all the above is done, i‚Äôll reach out to Susan for Listing creation. <@1066465177140215928> Please let me know your pricing so I can prepare ahead of time üòÅ

Is this plan sounded to the team? üòÉ
<@1054411267340763216> I would love to have the contract template ao I can start preparing it if you can share that with me üòÅ
  - 2024-10-13 | Quick recap on what i have done up to date:
- Trademark for my brand was filed Oct 3rd. After that I have my designer had been customizing my packaging and product with my brand logo on them.
- By the end of last week, I have just received my final design for the packaging box and on my product from the designer 
- I sent the design to my supplier and they will start making a sample with my logo on it (which takes about a week or so) for me to apply for brand registry.
  - 2024-10-13 | Thank you <@1066465177140215928> and <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out to me üòÅ I just finished work and heading into church now! I will update you shortly later about my current progress! üôå

  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Minh, sorry I didnt join today call due to last min work issue. I submitted my potential product yesterday. Can help me take a look and give me advice? Thanks a lot!
  - 2024-10-29 | Hi Minh, I have just submitted my PR Homework for 1 potential product. Thanks
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi Minh, thanks for yr help as always! I will forgo this product and am still looking for other potential product instead.
  - 2024-10-21 | Hi Minh, thanks for analysing.

1. Moving forward, I need to submit the Product Research Tracking Sheet or Product Research Homework via airtable? I am quite confused.

2. The top AMZ with highest 1,342 counts is a AMZ resale, but there is also another AMZ seller in the middle not doing good sales. I thought it might be good.

2. As long as the top revenue sellers are from CN and US sellers are in between, it should be ok?

  - 2025-02-03 | Hello friends! I am happy to introduce myself. My name is Jeseca and I am from Dallas, TX. I have experience in nails, leasing, and business development in the construction industry. Currently, I am a stay at home mom. I have a 4 month old, 8 year old, 10 year old, and 5 step kids. My hobbies include going to the gym, trying new restaurants, cooking, traveling, and training our kids in pretty much every sport. I wanted to join this journey because I wanted to do the best thing I could possibly do for myself. I have been dedicating all of my time to my kids, my baby, their school, sports, and extracurriculars. I have been struggling to find my purpose besides just being a mom. I want to be more than that. I want to be an entrepreneur, be my own boss, and possibly a mentor. I want to be independent and be able to bring something to the table for my family. I am doing this for my kids, my husband, and my parents. I want to be able to give them everything they have ever dreamt of. My goal in 1-2 years would be to have a successful thriving business, master this program, and possibly be a mentor myself. When I face challenges, I would tell myself ¬†‚ÄúKeep going even when you feel like giving up and remember what you‚Äôre here for‚Äù.
¬†
I am looking forward to networking with everyone! üôÇ

  - 2025-02-17 | My wins the past couple of weeks: 
1. Established LLC & EIN
2. Completed 30 Day Checklist
3. Winning product approved by Minh this morning! üòä 

I am not going to lie, I was discouraged after the first couple of no‚Äôs from Minh for products I was so confident about. And the product I wanted to submit to Minh I wasn‚Äôt even sure about anymore but my husband told me ‚Äúsubmit it anyways, submit everything that you have!‚Äù. And voila that one ended up being the winning product! So, in times of doubt, DO IT ANYWAY. The worst thing that can happen is you get a ‚Äúno‚Äù and just go back and keep doing it until you get a ‚Äúyes‚Äù! Keep good & positive mindset always, keep going through roadblocks, and you will get the outcome you desire. ü©∑üå∏

  - 2025-02-20 | She did also offer me some different looking models that I don‚Äôt see on AMZ yet. Maybe those can do?
  - 2025-02-20 | So I guess we cannot do the same model as them as she says. But I will ask her about updated/new models and research that as well!
  - 2025-02-20 | Good afternoon SHIFU‚Äôs! So I ended up activating my seller account this morning but have to wait 24hrs for payment verification. Once that is done I will get started on dummy listing.

In the meantime, I have a question about product sourcing.. so I couldn‚Äôt find the specific product that I am going after on alibaba so I asked Macy to source. She said that specific model is already being sold on Amz in the US by the top seller. So now we are looking at other models. In this market mostly everyone is selling different models of the same item that offers the same specs. So with that being said, how do I know which model to go after now? Any help would be greatly appreciated üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº <@536075832658231299> <@1059659092475531444> <@1054411267340763216> <@454372168852045844>

  - 2025-02-20 | Hi guys I have a question. So I set up my LLC using my home address and so is my business checking account address. I am re thinking this as I just found out address will be public and I don‚Äôt want my home address to be visible on my Amz store front. I had signed up for seller account today so it is pending approval. I do intend to change my address now.. what should I do? Should I wait for my Amz account to be approved, THEN go change my LLC address and bank account address? Or will my LLC address not matter and I can just change my bank account address and address on Amz seller account? I don‚Äôt really know how to go about this now‚Ä¶ ü•≤ Your insight would be greatly appreciated üôèüèº <@1059659092475531444> <@1054411267340763216> <@454372168852045844>

  - 2025-01-31 | Hello team, my name is Ryan Dang. I am currently serving as US Army National Guard and based in McAllen, Texas. I do believe in " leader are those who serves " so I have grown up with the mindset of giving to others. One of the best way of giving is to build a sustainable income stream that allowed me to not only help my family but to help others family as well, that is why I have looking up for any online-based business opportunity and I found one of the post of Justin dated back to 2021.

A little more about me, I am study in Business Administration, I love outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, shooting. 

Lastly, thank you Justin and coaches for the opportunity.

  - 2025-02-20 | Reflection: Visited my family in the villages of Vietnam for the first time in my life. Been dealing with food poisoning after and have been puking with body aches and  chills so it put me behind starting my weekly goals. Was able to finish the art of the deal (do recommend reading this), Module 4 & was able to get feedback from Macy on second round of samples.
1. Review sample feedback and follow up with Macy  to finalize which supplier to go with
2.Module 5
3. Research on fivver for options on graphic designers &
  - 2025-02-12 | Even though I'm not a personal fan of him, I think he makes some solid points on ways you can watch out for yourself, how to stand firm when interacting with others so you are not swayed or bent by their opinion, ways to stand out from competition. I don't always agree with his actions in how he handles his deals because it can seem very snakey or dishonest even as he is narrating the book. But I am enjoying learning from him even though I don't always agree. It's valuable to see from his perspective still and I am able to apply what I think aligns with my moral compass.

Use to build 6-12 month fund as a safety net, allows you to have peace of mind on not getting emotional in decision making
Do not overly invest in 9-5, it‚Äôs all about balance. Opportunity cost of investing more time to focus on your own business vs spending more time only making $xx at corporate. 
Own business has exponential growth, 9-5 has linear growth. Business should exceed 9-5 job income.

Scaling - Build strong systems
Systems must be a well oiled machine with first product before scaling to more
Don‚Äôt fall into shiny object syndrome, searching for next ‚Äúbest thing‚Äù can be a distraction when you are not established yet
Relationship with VAs and SOPS must all be in place 
Philippines or Vietnam $3-5 hourly = low skill, $10 hourly = high skill
Start with lower cost options for VAs to get the experience (don‚Äôt fall into paralysis loop when starting)
Job descriptions = important when hiring, be clear & set clear guidelines & expectations
Once hired, give VA time for adjustment & create opportunities to test them & their abilities. Underperforming = move on (with lower costing VAs) or communicate & set boundaries 
One VA per product = ideal

Sticking to Goals
Create clear & measurable business goals (Journal, Fitness, Wins, Weekly Goals, Daily Twos)
Daily & Weekly schedule to prioritize tasks (Atomic Habits Book will help with this)
Delegate non-core tasks to free up time for scaling (make less decisions, reduce decision fatigue)
Review progress on a regular basis to stay accountable

  - 2025-02-20 | Hi Jamie. Thanks for checking in. Sorry ive been MIA. I‚Äôve been having food poisoning last few days after visiting my family in the villages in Vietnam. Will be able to get those updates and feedback in tonight
  - 2024-12-13 | I've gotten back in the groove with PR and feel like all the experience I had sourcing with suppliers & Macy's was very helpful in giving me a more holistic reality on the process. My main struggle is maintaining my motivation and not letting these be setbacks and use it more as learning experiences.
  - 2024-12-13 | I'm back to PR for the third time now. The first 2 instances I had my products approved, the items proved too difficult of markets to enter / source.

  - 2025-02-06 | How amazing!! Goals!! ü§©
  - 2025-02-06 | Woke up to my first real 5 star rating. I had to double check to make sure I wasn‚Äôt seeing things. üòÖ Only striving for more!! üôè
  - 2025-01-25 | No, I think its right. Cause I'm waiting too. haha
  - 2025-01-29 | Do we have a sheet showing how to set our bids and how to calculate it for PPC Optimization?
  - 2025-02-18 | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GvhVSpxYyy2VYh3ZwAM3fJxLi77YVW4-M3jETy5kVE/edit?usp=sharing
  - 2025-02-18 | Hi, I'd like to re-optimize my bids. I was thinking of uploading on PPC assistant. Would I need to re-upload PPC tracker again??
  - 2025-02-13 | Like for example, if I got the goods for $20/unit then that‚Äôs what I should put down for COG??
  - 2025-02-13 | I just saw the feature on sellerboard where we can input COG of my product. Is that how much it cost to manufacture one unit?
  - 2025-02-11 | Hi <@1066465177140215928> , thank you for your feedback! I greatly appreciate it. Today, I tried applying for the American Express business credit card and I put down 100k but then after I got asked to connect to my business bank account. They will see that I don't actually have that much income yet in my account. What should I do next?? I did not think it was going to ask to be connected to my business bank account.
  - 2025-02-10 | I have some things on my mind I want to ask you guys. Now, that I am about to sell out of my first batch I understand I will need to order another batch. However, my concern is how will i continue to have enough captial to keep going?? This next batch I am assuming will need to be at least 400-500 units which for my product will cost roughly about 8-10k that doesn't include shipping and inspection. I am noticing a lot of my sales are going mainly to ad cost which I will definitely need to work on that. Lowering ad cost and getting more organic sales will help a lot.  My net profit so far with 106 units sold is at $1400. I plan on using my profit and credit card to reinvest into this new batch. My question is, how can I continue to have enough capital to keep going that is my main worry at the moment. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! Thank you so much!
  - 2025-02-09 | I went into the user portal and increased annual income but it doesn‚Äôt give me the option for a credit increase. I‚Äôm wondering if I should just call in and ask if I‚Äôm eligible for an increase?? I‚Äôve been with them for 6 months now.
  - 2025-02-08 | Okay, thanks!! I will try that!
  - 2025-02-08 | Thank you <@536075832658231299> ! I have a question regarding credit cards. Now that I have traction with my business and actual sales. I have a business card with Chase now but I want to increase my limit. I am hoping since I have proof showing that I am making actual sales now I will get approved for more. What are your suggestions on that?
  - 2025-02-06 | When is a good time to restock?? I have under 90 left in stock and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll run out and won‚Äôt get the next shipments in time. Should I go ahead and restock asap??
  - 2025-02-04 | Okay, submitted <@536075832658231299> ! Thank you!
  - 2025-02-04 | 
  - 2025-02-04 | Hey <@1307070727966687313> , I wasn't given a meeting link in the email??
  - 2025-02-02 | I select date range and select all but CTR
  - 2025-02-02 | Here is where I export it.
  - 2025-01-31 | <@1307070727966687313>
  - 2025-01-31 | Let me know if you can see that
  - 2025-01-31 | Can you download it?
  - 2025-01-31 | Not sure why when I export into excel and upload it onto here it comes up like this
  - 2025-01-31 | 
  - 2025-01-30 | Okay, submitted!
  - 2025-01-29 | For example, my ACOS for Exact is at .33 and you said to set it to .40.
  - 2025-01-29 | Hi <@1307070727966687313> , I'm trying to optimize my PPC and I am not fully understanding how to calculate to get the right numbers for my bids. Can you please when you have time give me an example of how I would calculate it?
  - 2025-01-29 | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GvhVSpxYyy2VYh3ZwAM3fJxLi77YVW4-M3jETy5kVE/edit?usp=sharing
  - 2025-01-25 | 
  - 2025-01-23 | Where it says -360.28 being charged. What does that mean?
  - 2025-01-23 | Is this the amount I‚Äôm being charged for advertising??
  - 2025-01-22 | Also just got an email on this!? Seems like the customer never received the package..in what ways can I solve this so it doesn‚Äôt happen
  - 2025-01-22 | How do I know I need it??
  - 2025-01-21 | What is this?? Should I follow the steps to get this done?
  - 2025-01-16 | 
  - 2025-01-16 | How would I go back and edit my coupon??
  - 2025-01-16 | 
  - 2025-01-15 | I just now saw this! Why did my coupon fail?? I wasn't sure what to put for budget so I just put $100. It says there are no valid product on this coupon??
  - 2025-01-12 | Okay, gotcha! I will schedule a call with you!
  - 2025-01-12 | I'm noticing also that my units are taking a bit long to process through is that usual? As it is my first units of products that are being processed?
  - 2025-01-12 | I contacted an Amazon associate about my 41 researching products and he said it may take another 2-3 weeks before all the items are processed through. He said the reason may be because of multiple reasons. It could be that they are verifying the weight/dimensions of the product or it has been misplaced, or damaged. Whatever the case he said by the end of the month if it has not been returned to my inventory then they will reimburse me the correct amount for my units. I think I may have to wait until then to fully launch? What do you think <@536075832658231299> ??
  - 2025-01-11 | I'd like to schedule a call to launch if that's okay with you. I'm probably going to be ready soon.
  - 2025-01-11 | Also, <@1307070727966687313> I
  - 2025-01-11 | I am currently trying to do some work on the listing beforehand.
  - 2025-01-11 | I couldn't find the video where it shows how to best title my amazon listing..Where can I find that?
  - 2025-02-07 | Hi, just wanted to confirm that the mastermind event is moved to March 15? Also, who‚Äôs all going?? Would love to hook up! üòä

  - 2025-01-10 | Hey @everyone 
Unfortunately, the Helium 10 webinar recording wasn‚Äôt shared after the session, but I wanted to share my notes in case they might be helpful to someone.
Since I used a translator, some parts of the information may not be 100% accurate, but I hope it still adds value!
I‚Äôm also attaching an Excel sheet that might be useful for your analysis or work. 

Key Points of the Webinar: Speaker Cyndi Thomason.

1. Profit First Methodology:
Core Principle: Prioritize profit first, then allocate the remaining funds for expenses.
Parkinson's Law: Expenses always grow to match available resources. Separating cash flows helps control spending.
Key Strategy: Use bank accounts to allocate funds:
Main account (operating expenses).
Inventory account.
Profit account.

2. Cash Flow Management Recommendations:
Separate expenses: Create individual bank accounts for inventory and operating expenses.
Quarterly Profit Distributions: Use half for personal needs, leave the other half in a reserve fund.
Perform regular expense reviews (quarterly) to identify and cut unnecessary costs.
Set aside a percentage of revenue (e.g., 1% initially) for the profit account.

3. Credit Card Recommendations: This method defently she learned from <@975774205658411068> 
Use separate credit cards for inventory and operating expenses.
Monitor credit use carefully to avoid cash flow disruptions.

4. Budget Allocation:
After setting aside funds for inventory, allocate the remaining balance as follows:
Profit: 5‚Äì15%.
Owner‚Äôs pay.
Taxes.
Operating expenses (lowest priority).

5. Product Optimization:
Regularly assess product profitability, especially for the top 10% and bottom 10% of your inventory.
Periodically review pricing and costs for each product.
Plan for profitability during the product development stage.

6. Calculation Tools:
Owner Pay Calculator: Helps determine how much you can pay yourself based on revenue and margins.
Use calculators to assess costs and product profitability, available on the speaker‚Äôs website.

7. Key Recommendations:
Build a business focused on profitability, not just revenue growth.
Pay yourself to ensure your business does not become an "expensive hobby."
Create reserve funds to cover unforeseen expenses.

8. Long-term Investments:
Profit accounts can be used for investments (bonds, funds), but ensure you have liquid funds for emergencies.

  - 2025-02-17 | Key Takeaways from Monday Motivation Session with Charlie

1. Real Connection Matters More Than Digital One
In today's world, we are "connected" through social media but rarely engage in meaningful interactions.
It‚Äôs important to have real conversations, turn on the camera, and see people‚Äôs emotions and reactions.

2. Movement and Breathing for Energy and Clarity
Before starting important work, it‚Äôs beneficial to stretch or do light exercises.
Deep breathing helps improve focus, relax, and cultivate gratitude for the present moment.

3. Gratitude as a Tool for Success
Practicing gratitude daily helps recognize the positive moments and opportunities we have.
Many people in the world don‚Äôt have the same opportunities, so it‚Äôs important to appreciate what we do have.

4. Entrepreneurship = Leadership
Being an entrepreneur is hard because you have to lead yourself.
We are used to being guided by parents, school, or work, but as entrepreneurs, we must take full responsibility for our own direction.

5. Stress is a Growth Tool, Not an Enemy
Stress is not our enemy; it is the key to unlocking our potential.
Research shows that people who believe stress is harmful have a 43% increased risk of premature death.
Those who see stress as a challenge don‚Äôt suffer from it but instead grow stronger.

6. Change Your Perspective on Stress
Example: Two bricklayers do the same job‚Äîone just lays bricks, the other builds a cathedral.
Change your mindset: Stress is not a problem; it‚Äôs an opportunity to grow.

7. Eliminate Unnecessary Stress
There is valuable stress (which helps us grow) and non-valuable stress (which drains us).
Unnecessary stress includes:
Worrying about things you can‚Äôt control.
Holding onto resentment and negativity.
Constantly comparing yourself to others.
Perfectionism and fear of mistakes.

8. Action is the Best Cure
Don‚Äôt dwell on the past‚Äîact.
Stress from inactivity is worse than stress from progress.

9. Growth Comes Through Struggles
No growth without challenges: muscles grow from strain, and a butterfly becomes strong by struggling out of its cocoon.
The harder the journey, the stronger you become.

10. Let Go of Unnecessary Weight
Anger, grudges, and regrets are like a heavy backpack that holds you back.
Forgiveness is not for others‚Äîit‚Äôs for your own peace.

11. Reflection Questions:
What stress in my life is helping me grow?
What stress do I need to let go of?
How can I shift my mindset so stress works for me, not against me?
  - 2025-02-07 | <@750566740424917045>
  - 2025-01-24 | Thank you dear Susan ‚ù§Ô∏èüëå
  - 2025-02-08 | 7. The Power of Reviews & Long-Term Reputation
A great dish (product) needs appealing presentation (listing) and positive reviews (reputation).
Customers trust reviews‚Äîthe more 5-star ratings you have, the stronger your sales will be.
Aim for at least 50 reviews as quickly as possible for stability and profitability.
Key Lesson: Amazon success is a marathon, not a sprint.
Final Takeaways: Your Entrepreneur‚Äôs Checklist
‚úÖ Daily affirmations & physical movement to start the day
‚úÖ Avoid distractions (reduce phone use before bed)
‚úÖ Find an accountability partner
‚úÖ Focus on high-impact activities (20%) that drive 80% of results
‚úÖ Optimize your Amazon listing by studying successful competitors
‚úÖ Invest in high-quality images, strong bundling, and compelling descriptions
‚úÖ PPC only amplifies what already works‚Äîoptimize before spending big
‚úÖ Reviews = Reputation. Aim for 50+ reviews to solidify credibility
‚úÖ Keep improving. Amazon success is built over months, not weeks.
Your Challenge:
For the next 7 days, apply one of these principles and track your progress. Small daily improvements lead to massive long-term success.
Closing Thought:
"Entrepreneurship is not about how fast you win‚Äîit‚Äôs about who keeps improving until they succeed."
  - 2025-02-08 | SHIFU Saturday Membership Recap: Key Insights for Entrepreneurs

1. The Power of Self-Affirmation and Physical Readiness
Entrepreneurship demands not just strategic thinking but also mental resilience. The session began with a crucial reminder: affirmations matter. You must tell yourself daily:
‚úîÔ∏è "I am smart, capable, and ready to achieve great things."
‚úîÔ∏è "I am the best version of myself, and I will keep improving."

2. Comfort vs. Growth: The Entrepreneur‚Äôs Challenge
One of the most striking messages was about the danger of comfort. Growth comes from pushing beyond what feels easy.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è "Comfort is the enemy of progress."
Much like how pressure transforms coal into diamonds, challenges shape an entrepreneur‚Äôs journey. If you signed up to build a business, expect obstacles‚Äîdaily. The key is how you respond to them.
‚úîÔ∏è Meditation & Clarity ‚Äì Take time to reflect, put away distractions (especially your phone), and breathe deeply. This reduces stress and increases focus.
‚úîÔ∏è Disrupt Bad Habits ‚Äì Try not using your phone before bed for 7 days and observe how it impacts your focus and productivity.

3. Accountability & Community Support
Being part of a supportive community increases your chances of success. 
Task: Find an accountability partner and commit to checking in with them regularly.

4. The Amazon Success Formula: 80/20 Rule
Entrepreneurs often confuse being busy with being productive. The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) applies to Amazon success:
‚úîÔ∏è 20% of your actions drive 80% of your results.
‚úîÔ∏è Focus on what moves the needle, not on distractions.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Top 3 Priorities for Amazon Sellers:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Product Excellence ‚Äì Choose or refine a product with high demand.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Listing Optimization ‚Äì Create engaging, high-quality images, infographics, and compelling copy.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Marketing ‚Äì Invest in PPC campaigns strategically (not blindly).

5. Amazon Listing Strategy: Studying the ‚ÄúSmart Kids‚Äù
One of the most valuable insights from this session was how to optimize your product listing.
‚úîÔ∏è Find the ‚ÄòSmart Kids‚Äô (Successful Competitors)
Look for competitors with high sales but fewer reviews‚Äîthese sellers are doing something right.
Study their bundling strategies, pricing, and presentation.
‚úîÔ∏è Invest in High-Quality Images & Infographics
The first product image must be eye-catching and clearly communicate value.
Infographics should emphasize why your product is better.
Show bundled items visually, as customers buy based on perceived value.
‚úîÔ∏è Understand Customer Behavior
Women tend to invest more in beauty, while pet owners often prioritize budget-friendly products.
The Blue Ocean Strategy teaches differentiation: instead of competing directly, find a unique angle.

6. PPC & ACoS: The Metrics That Matter
‚ñ∂Ô∏è PPC is an Amplifier, Not a Solution
If your product & listing are weak, PPC will not save you‚Äîit will just burn money faster.
If your foundation is strong, PPC will amplify success.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Understanding ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales)
If you spend $10 and attract 10 people but only 3 buy, your ACoS is 30%.
A high ACoS (above 70%) indicates poor listing optimization, weak offer, or pricing issues.
A good target ACoS for beginners is 30-50%, improving over time with better listing and optimization.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Optimization Steps
‚úîÔ∏è Adjust pricing
‚úîÔ∏è Improve images & bundling
‚úîÔ∏è Get more reviews
Takeaway: If after two months your ACoS is still above 100%, schedule a call with a coach for a listing audit.
  - 2025-01-25 | Saturday Session from <@1066465177140215928> üêùüë∏

1. Handling Supplier Issues:
Problem: A shipment of 3,000 units had a critical issue‚ÄîEuropean plugs were used instead of U.S. plugs.

Resolution Options:
1. Intercept the goods before delivery to Amazon, fix the plugs via a 3PL (third-party logistics), and repackage.

2. Allow the goods to reach Amazon, then remove them for rework.

3. Ship the goods back to the seller directly.
Chosen Solution: Intercept the goods and fix the issue with a 3PL provider to avoid delays and additional handling costs.

2. Negotiation Tactics:
Negotiation with Supplier:
Susan‚Äôs goal was to have the supplier cover 100% of the costs or at least 80%.
Strategy included highlighting her investment in their partnership (e.g., over $200,000 spent on orders).
Mentioned exploring alternative suppliers to create leverage.
Outcome: The supplier agreed to cover the full cost of $3,200 for fixing the plugs.
Payment Terms: Negotiated a partial 30-day payment term, paying $5,000 out of a $15,000 invoice after 30 days, with plans to renegotiate for better terms in future orders.

3. Leveraging Third-Party Logistics (3PL):
Susan found a 3PL provider, Jimmy, who offered a cost-effective solution.
Jimmy‚Äôs team handled:
Inspecting and reworking the goods (swapping out plugs).
Preparing the goods for Amazon shipment.
Ensuring customs clearance and smooth logistics.

4. Building Supplier Relationships:
Key Relationship Practices:
Use a sourcing agent (Macy) to handle supplier negotiations and logistics.
Regularly negotiate pricing and payment terms.
Demonstrate growth potential (e.g., expanding sales channels like TikTok, Etsy, and Walmart).
Maintain a positive, professional relationship to foster long-term trust and collaboration.

5. Strategic Insights:
Negotiation Mindset:
Always give before asking‚Äîinvest time and money to build trust with suppliers.
Showcase that you‚Äôre a valuable partner by highlighting your order volume and growth potential.
Alternatives: Actively seek new suppliers as leverage to show your current supplier they are not your only option.

6. Key Takeaways from Mentorship (Justin‚Äôs Advice):
Be willing to walk away from a deal if necessary.
Focus on building strong relationships and demonstrating consistent performance.
Keep multiple options open to avoid dependency on one supplier.
Treat every challenge as an opportunity to learn and improve negotiation skills.

7. Cost of Doing Business:
Accept that mistakes and unforeseen issues are part of running a business.
Minimize the impact of problems by negotiating favorable terms and finding creative solutions.

8. Personal Development and Accountability:
Susan‚Äôs Example: By staying calm and strategic, she managed a complex issue effectively.
Accountability Partner: Having someone to hold you accountable and offer support is crucial in overcoming challenges.

9. Practical Advice for Students:
Using Tools: Employ 3PL providers and sourcing agents to handle logistics efficiently.

Networking: Build relationships with suppliers, agents, and mentors to expand opportunities.

Mindset: Stay patient and focused, as success requires consistent effort and long-term planning.
  - 2025-01-25 | Overview and Structure of the Saturday Session from <@975774205658411068> 

1. Basics of Selling on Amazon:
Product Selection: The product should have potential, and it‚Äôs essential to highlight its advantages compared to competitors.
Listing Quality: Ensure your listing (images, description) is professionally crafted. This is the foundation for a successful launch.
Pricing: Your price should be competitive and reasonable to minimize customer resistance to purchase.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) show how effectively your business is performing. The main metrics include:
ACoS: Advertising Cost of Sales. An ideal ACoS is below 100% during the launch phase.
Organic and Sponsored Sales: Compare the share of organic sales with sales through advertising. Gradual growth in organic sales to 30-40% indicates increasing reputation.

3. Automation and Tools:
Sell Board: A tool for tracking sales data, costs, and profits.
Helium 10: Useful for data analysis, tracking returns, and improving marketing campaigns.
A/B Testing (PickFu): Use it to test and optimize images for better performance.

4. Importance of Mentorship and Relationships:
Building relationships with mentors and other business participants is key to success.
Collaboration: Work with other sellers instead of competing directly.
Mentorship Approach: Form your own opinions based on the knowledge you gain.

5. Setting Realistic Goals:
Don‚Äôt expect instant profit. The initial goal is to break even.
Review sales data monthly and track profit growth.

6. Managing Risks:
For beginners, it‚Äôs crucial to choose less competitive niches to reduce risks.
Start with smaller volumes and less costly campaigns (e.g., with low cost-per-click).

7. Quality Control and Logistics:
Quality control of the first batch is critically important. Defective goods can harm your reputation.
Work with reliable suppliers and use sourcing agents to improve terms.

8. Product and Advertising Management:
Use auto and manual PPC campaigns. Auto campaigns help find keywords, while manual campaigns strengthen successful strategies.
Focus on targeting competitors through ASIN campaigns.

9. Philosophy and Long-Term Strategy:
Business is a marathon, not a sprint. Don‚Äôt rush to expand your product line until the first product is successful.
Learn to manage expectations and build brand reputation.

10. Personal Growth and Success Mindset:
Positive Image: Be friendly and resolve conflicts publicly with dignity.
Focus: Stay focused on long-term goals and avoid distractions.
Self-Development: Learn from successful people and strengthen your skills.

  - 2024-12-29 | Don‚Äôt Rush to Quit the 9-5 Job. Class today with <@975774205658411068> üèÜ

1. Wait for consistent income: Your business should consistently generate income equal to or exceeding your job salary for 6+ months before leaving.

2. Build an emergency fund: Save at least 6-12 months‚Äô worth of expenses before quitting your job.

3. Use your current job as a tool: Your 9-5 income helps fund and test business ideas without emotional pressure.

4. Balance your time: Avoid over-investing in your 9-5 job. Consider the opportunity cost of time that could be used to grow your business.

5. Make data-driven decisions, not emotional ones: Ensure your transition is based on financial stability and business growth potential.

Scaling the Business
1. Create sustainable systems: Before expanding your business or adding new products, ensure current operations run smoothly.

üö©High-skill: ~$10/hour.
Start small by assigning weekend tasks to test their proactivity and work ethic.
Clearly define job descriptions and expectations during the hiring process.

3. Plan for scaling:
Assign one VA per product.
Develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all processes.
Ensure a product is profitable and established before launching the next one.

4. Avoid distractions: Stay away from "shiny object syndrome" ‚Äî new ideas that divert focus from your core business.


Delegation and Simplification
1. Optimize tasks:
Create clear daily and weekly schedules.
Delegate non-core tasks to focus on scaling the business.

2. Reduce decision-making:
Simplify everyday choices (e.g., wear only black and white shirts).
Use "Atomic Habits" to build sustainable routines.üìñ

3. Seek support: Ask family members to assist with routine tasks, freeing up time for business priorities.

Relationships and Approach in Business
1. Build long-term relationships:
Avoid making snap judgments about people based on rumors or initial impressions.
Don‚Äôt burn bridges, even if someone is challenging to work with. Approach relationships with respect and understanding.

2. Work collaboratively: Foster positive connections, as they may become valuable in the future.

Focus on Goals 
1. Clarify goals: Set measurable business goals (e.g., document achievements, daily and weekly tasks in a journal).

2. Regular progress reviews: Assess your accomplishments to stay aligned with your objectives.

3. Consistency and discipline: Use schedules and habits to maximize productivity.

üèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜMain Takeaway: Before leaving your job, establish a strong foundation for your business. Strong systems, consistent income, strategic scaling, and a focus on long-term strategy are the keys to success.

üß¥ Choose the right skincare cream. I have sensitive and delicate skin, and I‚Äôve tried many brands. For the past four years, I‚Äôve been using Medik8, and it has worked perfectly for me.

üíß Drink more water ‚Äì hydration from the inside is just as important as external skincare!

1. Go to the Help Section:
In your Amazon Seller Central account, open the Help tab.
2. Find the Get Help and Resources Section.
3. Why Not Open a Case:
Opening a case can take too long and delay the resolution. Instead, it‚Äôs more effective to call Amazon Support directly.
4. How to Prepare for the Call:

Identify the issue: For example, specify Issue with Asset for Premium A Plus.

Provide the ASIN for the product in question.

Prepare your phone number for the callback.
5. Steps to Make the Call:

Click Call me now and make sure you are near your phone.
Be ready to answer the call and explain the issue in detail.
6. Specifics of Calling Amazon Support:
In some cases, it might take multiple calls as the first consultant might not be qualified to resolve the issue.

If the consultant says they cannot help, thank them politely, hang up, and repeat the process by submitting the form again.

7. My Experience Resolving the Issue:
I had to make calls for about 4-5 hours and speak to over 15 different people before reaching the right specialist.
The specialist immediately filled out the form from their side, and within a few hours, my listing had access to Premium A Plus.
8. Advice:
Don‚Äôt give up after the first attempt. Keep calling until you reach a consultant who can assist.
Emphasize that Premium A Plus access must be updated directly on Amazon‚Äôs end.

Key Takeaways from Bernard‚Äôs PPC Podcast 
üèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜ
1. A Proper PPC Launch Strategy is Key to Success
‚Ä¢ Three-Phase PPC Strategy: 
‚Ä¢ Phase 1 (Launch & Initial Ranking):
‚Ä¢ Use only Exact Match campaigns for the initial push.
‚Ä¢ Campaigns should be focused on highly relevant keywords (up to 50-100 keywords).
‚Ä¢ Do not mix different keyword intents (e.g., ‚Äúmen‚Äôs running shoes‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs running shoes‚Äù should not be in the same campaign).
‚Ä¢ Avoid automation until you understand what works.
‚Ä¢ Phase 2 (Expansion & Optimization):
‚Ä¢ Add Phrase Match and Broad Match campaigns.
‚Ä¢ Use Sponsored Products and ASIN Targeting.
‚Ä¢ Enroll in Vine to gather reviews, as conversion rates significantly improve after the first 10-20 reviews.
‚Ä¢ Phase 3 (Profit Optimization & Scaling):
‚Ä¢ The goal is to reduce PPC costs and increase organic sales.
‚Ä¢ Track TACOS, ACOS, and organic ranking metrics.
‚Ä¢ Introduce automation only after solid data is available.
‚Ä¢ Use Keyword Harvesting ‚Äì move successful keywords into new campaigns and test them in different match types.
2. Understanding Product Positioning & Amazon‚Äôs Algorithm
‚Ä¢ Amazon‚Äôs ranking algorithm prioritizes recent sales over historical performance. 
‚Ä¢ Maintaining consistent daily sales is crucial for sustained ranking.
‚Ä¢ Amazon has new title requirements: 
‚Ä¢ Limited to 200 characters.
‚Ä¢ Cannot repeat the same keyword multiple times.
‚Ä¢ Certain special characters and words are now prohibited.
3. How to Reduce Wasted Ad Spend & Improve Profitability
‚Ä¢ Use N-gram analysis to identify irrelevant keywords (e.g., if your product is not organic, negative match "organic").
‚Ä¢ Do NOT rely on Amazon‚Äôs suggested bids ‚Äì they are often inflated, sometimes up to $40 per click. Instead: 
‚Ä¢ Aim for 85% of the suggested bid as a starting point.
‚Ä¢ Keep the launch budget at $200-250 per day for a proper PPC launch.
‚Ä¢ For high ACOS keywords: 
‚Ä¢ Move them to separate campaigns and lower bids manually.
4. Relaunch Strategy After Running Out of Stock
‚Ä¢ If a product was out of stock for 1-2 months, don‚Äôt start from scratch, but: 
‚Ä¢ Increase bids by 25-30% to regain ranking.
‚Ä¢ Focus on Exact Match and ASIN Targeting campaigns.
‚Ä¢ DO NOT run video ads or brand ads until organic traffic is restored.
5. When & How to Use Different Ad Types
‚Ä¢ Sponsored Products ‚Äì Essential for ranking; should be launched from day one.
‚Ä¢ Sponsored Brands Video ‚Äì Works well only if the product requires explanation.
‚Ä¢ Sponsored Brands ‚Äì Useful for scaling but not ranking.
‚Ä¢ Sponsored Display ‚Äì Primarily for brand defense, not growth.
6. Advice for Beginners
‚Ä¢ Do NOT outsource PPC at the beginning ‚Äì you must understand the basics first.
‚Ä¢ Learn and test on your own before delegating.
‚Ä¢ PPC success depends on the right product selection, optimized listing, and reviews ‚Äì not just ads.

  - 2025-02-21 | Thank you Susan üòä
  - 2025-02-21 | Do we need to file BOIR every year? Or is it a one time thing?
  - 2025-02-11 | Thank you for this. This will save me some money. Appreciate you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  - 2025-02-11 | Wow. Will keep this in mind. Any experience with ‚Äúfast sea shipping?‚Äù Vs regular sea shipping. My shipping agent says it will be 15 days vs 25 days.
  - 2025-02-11 | Okay got it. Thank you for clarifying. I almost did the 5 shipments with 1 label üòÖ

Thank you Tim! Appreciate your help.
  - 2025-02-11 | Oh. You mean FBA label for fast is different. Then I need to make another FBA for regular sea shipping?
  - 2025-02-11 | If we do the 5 warehouse like usual. We‚Äôll just set the estimated date differently for fast vs regular right? You think choosing west coast FC for fast shipment is better since it‚Äôs cheaper? Thank you for answering brother.
  - 2025-02-11 | If I am planning to do a fast sea shipping and regular sea shipping. Like half & half. Is there any changes/difference with FBA labels that I need to send to my supplier for regular and fast shipping?
  - 2025-02-11 | Oh wow. I should be thankful then üòÇ
  - 2025-02-10 | Thank you shifu. For storage fee, I saw 85$ charge on my account. Is that the typical price range or it will go up further depending on the units you have?
  - 2025-02-10 | How much amazon charge for sending back unfulfillable units to your house? Is it per unit?
  - 2025-02-06 | Hi, I got a complain from a customer and he returned my product. It says on the shipping address- KOREA, which is weird as I am only selling in USA. I researched the outlet voltage in korea is 220 and USA is only 110v. I think that is the reason why the unit did not work. Is there a way to avoid selling on other countries? Mainly ones that has a different voltage than US market?
  - 2025-02-03 | This was your experience too?
  - 2025-02-03 | I watched the video shifu. But it only says lost/damaged units in warehouse. So if a customer damaged it, then that is not reimbursable??
  - 2025-02-03 | Does amazon reimbursed returned units that has been damaged by customer? Or just units that has been damaged at their warehouse?
  - 2025-01-29 | Thank you brother! I will look into this one. üòä
  - 2025-01-28 | I see the reason for returns on voice of customer. But not the reason for replacement. Is there a specific tab where it says reason for replacement?
  - 2025-01-28 | Is there a way we can see the reason for a unit being sent as a "replacement" to a customer?
  - 2025-01-22 | I will just ignore the email about creating a removal order?
  - 2025-01-21 | Hi everyone. I setup all returns to be automatically sent back to me. However I still get email from AMZ about ‚Äúremoval order‚Äù. Do you still need to manually put a removal order for returns even you set it up to be sent back to you?
  - 2025-01-19 | Got it. Thank you for your input! üòä
  - 2025-01-19 | Thank you! I did raised it to 3$ and it went half of my usual. Is that a sweet spot already? Or observe on the third day?
  - 2025-01-17 | Wow. Very nice! Thank you for the tip. üòÑ
  - 2025-01-17 | Got it. thank you for the insight Carolina. When you increase your price, how much did you increase?
  - 2025-01-17 | Got it. Was this your strategy before selling out your first batch?
  - 2025-01-17 | For slowing down sales? Can we turn off ppc or lower the budget? Or increase the product price? To avoid getting sold out before half of my units arrive..
  - 2025-01-17 | Okay got it, Thank you both! <@1059659092475531444> <@613172337470341150> üòÑ
  - 2025-01-17 | Oooh. I thought the end-date. I am past then. lol. Is there going to be a violation or penalty fees?
  - 2025-01-17 | I got an hour left lol. Can I still edit it? Where can I edit it? üòÇ
  - 2025-01-17 | Hi, the half of my units are delayed with shipping to amazon warehouse. Is there going to be a violation if I am past my "delivery window" period? Do I need to edit it? If yes, where can I edit it to extend the time frame? Thank you..
  - 2025-02-06 | Hi, I got a complain from a customer and he returned my product. It says on the shipping address- KOREA, which is weird as I am only selling in USA. I researched the outlet voltage in korea is 220 and USA is only 110v. I think that is the reason why the unit did not work. Is there a way to avoid selling on other countries? Mainly ones that has a different voltage than US market?
  - 2025-02-03 | This was your experience too?
  - 2025-02-03 | I watched the video shifu. But it only says lost/damaged units in warehouse. So if a customer damaged it, then that is not reimbursable??
  - 2025-02-03 | Does amazon reimbursed returned units that has been damaged by customer? Or just units that has been damaged at their warehouse?
  - 2025-01-29 | Thank you brother! I will look into this one. üòä
  - 2025-01-28 | I see the reason for returns on voice of customer. But not the reason for replacement. Is there a specific tab where it says reason for replacement?

  - 2025-02-06 | Officially sold out with my second batch! I finally hit 100k+ sales! ü•πü•π

This is just 2+months of selling. I wonder what would be the total revenue if I wasn‚Äôt sold out during BF and Christmas season?!

New goal: 500K by the end of the year!! Let‚Äôs gooooo!! üéâüöÄ
  - 2025-02-01 | Thank you Shifu!

To be honest, I did not do something new for this batch. I have the same ppc campaign and no new keywords either. I actually slowed down my sales by increasing my price and decreasing my ppc budget because I did not expect my sales velocity to be double/triple from my first batch and I don‚Äôt want to be sold out again to avoid losing ranking. However, I‚Äôm still going to be sold out for a month or two due to lunar new year and unexpected increase in sales per day.

My product is somehow related to health/nutrition and I think I got lucky with the demand of the ‚ÄúNew year, new me‚Äù people for January 2025 which increased my sales. I think what I did differently this time is collecting FBM reviews which builds more trust with my product/brand and also helped increased my sales. I also increase my gift card from 10$ to 20$ in my manychat flow to help gather more reviews, but for some reason, some customers still does not want to leave a review haha. Lastly, I provide good customer service. If I get inquiry for my product I reply as fast as I can (10 minutes or less) and answer all their questions which shows that I am knowledgeable with my product. 

If there are manufacturing error such as defective units, missing product add-ons. I send replacements right away. Sometimes, I give them gift cards as a form of apology for our error and as a thank you for being a great customer and reaching out to me instead of sending back the product to amazon right away. I think losing some profit in return for customer‚Äôs satisfaction is worth it in the long run. I‚Äôd rather have less profit at first then earn 2 or 3x more in the long run.
  - 2025-02-01 | Thank you everyone!! 2025 will be our year!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™üèºüöÄ
  - 2025-02-01 | Sold over 500+ units this month! I can‚Äôt believe this is actually happening!! ü§Ø

January is a good month for me! Kinda sad that I will be sold out soon.

2025 is off to a great start! $56K in sales!! Let‚Äôs go!!! üöÄü•≥
  - 2025-01-29 | Thank you shifu. How do you know if you are in 30% opt in rate? Do you just manually count it? Or can you see it in your seller account?
  - 2025-01-29 | Woke up to this 5 star review and it already made my whole day! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Great customer service = More sales! I also gave this customer a 20$  gift card as a form of apology on our manufacturing error and as a thank you for being a great customer. That‚Äôs  another reason how I end up getting a good review from her.  1% everyday!! üí™üèº
  - 2024-12-13 | Thank you for the tip shifu!!

  - 2024-12-22 | I did watch it. It says you can see most of the keywords at auto and phrase? Then you have to click on ‚Äúnegative targeting‚Äù to add the negative keywords. Is this right? I might need to rewatch it lol
  - 2024-12-22 | Ohh got it. Meaning you will save money to avoid unnecessary clicks?  And you can see those negative keywords through search term report?
  - 2024-12-22 | hi <@1066465177140215928>, just catching up with class recordings. Does negative keyword means = Keywords that you should put on your  list to avoid getting charged for your ppc?
  - 2025-02-06 | Oh I missed it. I thought it was 3 pm CST. Can you tag me for the recording if there is one? thanks üôÇ

  - 2024-09-29 | Is this the csv file? You download this from campaign manager. Then you can send it via airtable using ppc assistant tool and they will adjust it for you.
  - 2024-09-29 | I think they said you need to make a copy and do not edit on the original copy.

  - 2025-01-25 | Same question here. It does not carry over on the second tab on google sheets.  Is it because it is 2024? Can I also have the link for the 2025 data visibility you mentioned in your last class? Thank you. <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-11-15 | If I am still out of stock. Can I skip this homework for now and just do it once I have my 2nd batch?
  - 2025-02-16 | Got it. Thank you shifu!
  - 2025-02-15 | Found it. Thank you! Do I just tell to buy a converter? Or apologize for the confusion of voltage difference between USA and Europe?
  - 2025-02-15 | Can we send a message to them? Through amazon?
  - 2025-02-15 | This is what it is showing shifu. No asian countries or european countries..
  - 2025-02-15 | Hello everyone. I have another customer that complained and returned my product. He is from Greece and I think the voltage is different there as compared from US. This is the second one, the other one was from Korea. I only have my store open for US. How come they are shipping it to greece and asian countries? How can I turn off selling on those market? Can someone help me. Thank you. <@536075832658231299> <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2025-02-09 | Does amazon ban sellers if you get a "very poor" rating?
  - 2025-02-08 | Does a fair score something to be concerned of? Is this going to affect sales or can you get banned if you get a "very poor" rating? Does this restart eventually?
  - 2025-02-05 | Okay. Got it. Thank you shifu han
  - 2025-02-05 | Okay thank you. So in instances that my units went missing during inbound shipment. I‚Äôm still eligible for reimbursement right?
  - 2025-02-05 | Did I do it right shifu? The only thing that I want to make sure is that:

amazon will still reimburse me for my unit if they lose it and damage it at their warehouse.

Damaged by customers: I completely understand that I won‚Äôt be reimbursed for these units which I‚Äôm okay with.
  - 2025-02-05 | I chose option 3 for this one. To avoid customers getting a used product.
  - 2025-02-05 | I chose option 1 for this. Which I didn‚Äôt change because it was the default option.
  - 2025-02-05 | And for this picture (damaged inventory ownership setting) choose number 1 option. Shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2025-02-05 | I mean this is the picture I‚Äôm talking about choosing option 3. (Returned item evaluation)
  - 2025-02-04 | Just to clarify Shifu. Choose option 3 for  returned item evaluation and choose option 1 for damaged inventory ownership setting?
  - 2025-02-04 | I also saw this other setting which seems to be talking about Amazon's responsibility if they damage my goods in their warehouse. It is enabled, so I am guessing they will reimburse me if it was their fault.
  - 2025-02-04 | It is taking me to this page. Shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2025-02-04 | The phrase ‚Äúineligible for damage reimbursement‚Äù is only for the returned unit by customer right?

Just in case there will be an episode in the future where amazon loses some of my inventory. Will I still be eligible for reimbursement? This is my main concern before selecting the last option‚Ä¶
  - 2025-02-03 | Isn't it the same with the first option? I mean. I only have one product so it is basically all ASINs?
  - 2025-02-03 | What is the best option to choose here? Can you please advise. Thank you.
  - 2025-02-03 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> I called amazon support and apparently they do not know that particular setting where you can bypass the returned evaluation. They just said they will open a case for investigation to make sure that returned units that has been used is not being sold to a new customer.
  - 2025-02-03 | Got it. thank you shifu!
  - 2025-02-03 | Okay. I will update you tomorrow shifu. Should I just ask them on what's their process with returns? Is there anything specific you want me to ask them?
  - 2025-02-03 | Got it shifu han. I will update you tomorrow. Is it better to call them or chat with them?
  - 2025-02-02 | I‚Äôm just concerned about the 3rd option of ‚Äúnot being eligible for damage reimbursement‚Äù. Can you explain the scope of that damage reimbursement. 

Does that mean if amazon damaged my good during inbound or shipment to customer they won‚Äôt reimburse me for it?

Or if a customer filed for a return and did not send it back. I won‚Äôt get reimbursed? If I remember correctly, I think Louis told me that amazon will reimburse you after 90 days for units that is filed as ‚Äúreturns‚Äù but customers did not send it back. 

Can you please tell me the best thing to do? Thank you. üôèüèº
  - 2025-02-02 | Should I select to return all units to me and skip evaluation by amazon??
  - 2025-02-01 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> , I got this from "voice of the customer" I think one of the customer got a used product from a unit that amazon labeled as "sellable". Do you think this can lead to a bad review in the future? What are the pros and cons of letting amazon evaluate the returned units? I mean, I don't want to lose the eligibility for reimbursement of damaged goods but at the same time, I don't want customers to get a used product and get a bad review..
  - 2025-01-29 | Thank you shifu! I will do the same then.
  - 2025-01-29 | So you let Amazon decide if returns can be sellable?
  - 2025-01-29 | Would you recommend doing this option shifu? Do you have all your returned units sent back to you regardless if it is unopened??
  - 2025-01-29 | I don‚Äôt have to edit anything for this one shifu?
  - 2025-01-29 | Click the 3rd option? What‚Äôs going to happen if I am going to be ‚Äúineligible for damage reimbursement‚Äù? Am I going to lose money?
  - 2025-01-29 | Or this one? I saw a video on youtube about changing this setting if you want all returned items shipped back to you regardless if it is looking unopened/unused. But I want to confirm first with you shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2025-01-29 | is it here?
  - 2025-01-29 | Oh got it. How can we change the "sellable" to be returned to us?
  - 2025-01-29 | This is what my setting looks like. I did not click any of the  "grade/resell" or "refurbishment" that is why I am wondering why amz is still putting back the returned units back to my inventory..
  - 2025-01-29 | Yes it says unwanted item.
  - 2025-01-29 | It says product performance was poor though. So I think the customer used it first then send it back. Is this going to be a problem that a customer might receive a used product? 

Or does amazon staff checks what‚Äôs inside the box or if the product has been used before labeling it as sellable?
  - 2025-01-28 | Do you have your returns all sent back to your address??
  - 2025-01-28 | How come AMZ is automatically rating my returns as sellable and putting back it in my inventory? I chose the option to return all returned units to my address to avoid customers getting a used unit and priced as "brand new"..
  - 2025-01-13 | Got it. Thank you both! <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>
  - 2025-01-12 | Does amazon let you know? Or is it random? During special occasions/holidays?

when does it usually happen shifu han?
  - 2025-01-12 | Oh got it.. Is the discount just for newly launched and then it will be gone forever?
  - 2025-01-12 | Can I ask why amazon fees are higher this week? Last week was only 8$ per unit, now it is 22$ per unit..
  - 2025-01-03 | Thank you for the detailed explanation <@1066465177140215928> üòä
  - 2025-01-01 | Does it mean my trademark is approved? Or still on the process?
  - 2025-01-01 | 
  - 2025-01-01 | May I ask what does this mean?
  - 2024-10-28 | Got it. Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-10-28 | I did. Also, ACOS there says 7k+ Whereas, when I use campaign manager from amazon seller account, it is only 5k+.. (after I filter the date range from launch date to the day I closed my listing)
  - 2024-10-28 | So when computing it manually. Do we just deduct COGS and shipping from payout? (Payout minus COGS + shipping) ??
  - 2024-10-28 | But the payout from amazon.. Do they deduct already the ACOS, seller fees, refunds, and coupon discounts?
  - 2024-10-28 | I did, it says 4.2k in net profit. Shifu Justin just told me to do this method because sometimes, the sellerboard data might be inaccurate or not updated yet?

Thanks for the follow up brother. I'm trying to log in into my vault, but it's giving me an error message üôè
  - 2024-12-05 | I hope this message finds you all well. I want to sincerely apologize for my delayed responses. The past few weeks have been quite busy with work, and on top of that, my wife and I had a series of hospital follow-ups. Thankfully, everything is going well, and I‚Äôm thrilled to share some wonderful news, we welcomed our baby into the world earlier than expected! While we were preparing for a December 20th due date, our little one arrived on the 2nd, and we were released from the hospital just yesterday.

  - 2025-02-21 | I never heard of this before. So my new supplier is making me pay some tax fee and processing fee. Which equals up to 10% and then they‚Äôre forcing me to pay TT through Alibaba. Can‚Äôt let me leverage the credit card. I feel like this is not that good. Has anybody experienced this before ?any advice?

  - 2025-02-16 | Hi all! Wondering if anyone knows. when I run a coupon does Amazon take out less % for the FBA if they do then I‚Äôll run a $20 coupon. Or do they take the 15% FBA cost out from the original price it was priced for

  - 2025-01-21 | I started crying when I received these photos today. This month I donated to a fund in the Philippines to help feed hungry kids in the community. I took a risk as I just met this girl when I was interviewing her to become my VA but went with a different candidate. So I don‚Äôt know her personally, but I decided she had a good cause, and she made her own charity for the kids. I had my friend update me so I can spread the word. She did such a good job making cupcakes and brownies and getting drinks for the kids. Stretching the funds I gave her. The line was down the road üò≠ even tho I haven‚Äôt been selling for over a month now, this holiday is all about giving more than you get üôÇ anyone else interested in donating feel free to hit me up. Any amount goes a long way. Soon once I can get Amazon auto-piloted I‚Äôll go back helping out in medical missions. üí™üèª

  - 2024-10-11 | <@809813064756887582>
  - 2024-08-09 | does PPC work like an auction? Where if you bid more conservatively like suggested $3 you do $2 the other guy bids $3, $3.5, $4 will be above you on the key word search? Also running a ppc campaign does it shows up as sponsor right? the ones that show up without sponsor ranked organically?
  - 2024-08-08 | Got it makes sense thanks for explaining!
  - 2024-08-08 | What does CPR stand for? I googled it it says cerebro product rank so then the lower the better right? But then <@536075832658231299> PPC video says it stands for "the number of sales in the last 8 days" so then that means the higher the number the better??
  - 2024-11-04 | Yes, let me join in. I‚Äôm gonna start attending Wednesday‚Äôs class this week.
  - 2025-02-08 | yess coming back

  - 2025-02-06 | Doesn‚Äôt look like I can use the link to change it to Friday night‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôll be a quick question, but I have to be in front of the computer
  - 2025-02-06 | Ah I see. Gotta work two jobs tomorrow. 2:30 central time I‚Äôll be driving. Are you free after 6pm cst?
  - 2025-02-06 | I‚Äôll ask you tonight I feel like we keep going back in a circle. Probably not explain to myself well. If you can‚Äôt talk without any voice, no worries you can just type to me during our meeting
  - 2025-02-05 | I know I lost the keyboard ranking bc I was out of stock, but I‚Äôm wondering how come my brand name won‚Äôt come up when I search it or Asin. Have you ever encountered this before?
  - 2025-02-05 | My PPC is definitely working because I‚Äôm getting clicks and impressions, but I‚Äôm just wondering how come my brand-name is not showing up but maybe that‚Äôs more about Amazon problem
  - 2025-02-03 | Not sure if you guys ran into this problem before
  - 2025-02-03 | H2ydrate (brand name) and Asin not coming up in search box but they are getting clicks from my phrase and broad campaigns. And affiliate link works
  - 2025-02-03 | I just turned it on yesterday after not selling since November
  - 2025-02-03 | It‚Äôs been since 01/24 brand name and ASIN is not searchable :/ do you want me to just leave the campaign on?
  - 2025-02-03 | I am getting clicks and impressions
  - 2025-02-03 | I just turned them on yesterday
  - 2025-02-03 | So I had another problem, my listing is back from being flagged but it‚Äôs not searchable by brand name or ASIN but the affiliate link works and keywords. I called Amazon everyday for 2 weeks now and they keep telling me internal catalog team working on it wait wait. Any suggestions ?
  - 2025-02-03 | thanks! I scheduled
  - 2025-02-02 | I thought one is the FBA one FBM
  - 2025-02-02 | I‚Äôm confused this didn‚Äôt happen for my hydrogen water bottle when I made the listing. When are you free Han? Im home today
  - 2025-02-02 | I closed the listing too
  - 2025-02-02 | Why is it forcing my SKU to have a sale?
  - 2025-02-02 |

  - 2025-02-02 | 
  - 2025-02-01 | helpp so I made my listing but idk why its making me put in a sales price and date frame for sale how to get rid of this? i just closed the listing and will reopen when I launch. I dont want amazon to think this is my honeymoon period
  - 2025-02-01 | 
  - 2025-02-01 | Omg thanks Han! Thats worked. I started creating the listing and then did the brand registry after so I typed it out. Opps
  - 2025-02-01 | What do you think I should do?
  - 2025-02-01 | Hi! I need help so I‚Äôm making the listing for my second product and the brand registry application was approved but when I try to submit the product listing for a review. It gives me this error.
  - 2025-02-01 | 
  - 2025-02-01 | 
  - 2025-01-24 | Why do you think this occurred? None of the recent reviews said anything of adult category terms
  - 2025-01-24 | Morning Han! So I submitted a claim last night and got an email this morning that they will reactivate my listing in 72 hours so fingers crossed it happens. I reached out to a Fiverr lady last night to keep her on standby by
  - 2025-01-23 | So I have a problem. My listing got banded today. I didn‚Äôt even know they didn‚Äôt even send me an email. It is listed as an adult product, but it‚Äôs a hydrogen water bottle‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I submitted a case with Amazon. They said they‚Äôll get back to me in three days. Is there anything else I can do to speed it up?
  - 2025-01-20 | Yeah, the new seller in send it whatever I didn‚Äôt want to create a new seller account when I already had one
  - 2025-01-20 | Let me see what Amazon says. I just spoke to them and they said it‚Äôs been updated and it will be reflected in 24 hours but will keep you updated.
  - 2025-01-19 | Oh sorry hold on I had messaged Amazon 3 different thing ü§£
  - 2025-01-19 | I was just looking at this to see that I probably don‚Äôt qualify for these promotions, but they said I created a listing too late or something because my first listing was 2013? I registered for the brand and brand registry all within one month of May
  - 2025-01-19 | Not the referral fee I just want the special feature part to pop up üò≠
  - 2025-01-19 | <@536075832658231299> what should I do? I created my seller account back in 2013 when I was selling textbooks. Why are you punishing us new sellers üò≠ literally was working perfectly fine
  - 2025-01-19 | 
  - 2025-01-19 | got it thanks Han ill call them and submit a ticket before the last resort delete and upload file
  - 2025-01-19 | ohh ok im glad its not just me i thought it was my VA messing with my listing but she said she did not touch it
  - 2025-01-19 | yea color came up last time just special feature gone and then the weight was in kg for some reason and i had to fix it
  - 2025-01-19 | all a sudden its gone around end of dec and i waited to see if it would come back nope
  - 2025-01-19 | it shows up right there on top
  - 2025-01-19 | 
  - 2025-01-19 | see my competitor
  - 2025-01-19 | now only the matieral part shows up but no special feature part it happened a couple weeks ago how do i change it so the special feature part pops up in top?
  - 2025-01-19 | but now it seemed to have dissapeared?
  - 2025-01-19 | 
  - 2025-01-19 | so these use to be on my listing right on top
  - 2025-01-08 | I gave her and big boss more than this just this, but she really liked the strawberry bear that the fiverr lady recommended!
  - 2025-01-08 | Thanks for the recommendation! <@975774205658411068> and <@297667891992723457> I used her and I can say I was not disappointed. I don‚Äôt really care too much about the budget. I just wanted to show my supplier that they were appreciated and she definitely gave me a lot of good insight on what they might like such as they don‚Äôt like tea packets versus they like loose leaf better
  - 2025-01-06 | Yeah, I was in shock as well. Oh well, it‚Äôs all part of the business. Just mentally prepare yourself. There are sabotages out there. I don‚Äôt know if I could‚Äôve canceled the FBM if it will lose on my rating
  - 2025-01-04 | My product now smells like acetone and weird chemicals.
  - 2025-01-04 | 
  - 2025-01-04 | I‚Äôm not sure who needs to hear this, but a customer named Brian Nguyen which I googled owns Le Nails bought my fbm and then returned it a week later and glued the whole product together that I can‚Äôt clean it up. He gel X it. Do not fill his product guys if you see his name and his address.
  - 2025-01-11 | We got our own little mini mastermind meet up haha I found round one for us too. We can go hit that place up and win some cute plushy.

  - 2024-12-07 | I‚Äôd like to have a new business address in Florida for convenience, to pick up packages  or private mail in future

If the LLC can transferred to Florida without dissolving it might be easier, only need to comply with Florida‚Äôs sales tax laws, since it would be under a single state
  - 2024-12-07 | Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone here has experience moving your LLC from 1 state to another and could share some simple tips.

Would it be better to dissolve my LLC in Illinois, where it‚Äôs registered, and start a new LLC in Florida?

Or should I register as a foreign LLC in Florida? I‚Äôm concerned about the cost of maintaining in 2 states thankss

  - 2024-10-13 | I see what you're saying, the keywords with high impressions are the one I bid higher compared to the other
  - 2024-10-13 | 
  - 2024-10-13 | Means thoes keyword have no impression
  - 2024-10-13 | I just submitted a request for PPC assistance, and after reviewing the report for the last 15 days, I noticed that most of my keywords are not performing well. Only 2 or 3 keywords and product targeting have high impressions and a few sales since the launch. % ACOS is really high. Should I target new keywords? Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  - 2024-10-13 | Alright I see. Thank you

  - 2025-02-12 | Hello everyone, so I have placed my bulk order as of last wednesday, February 6th and I was told that factories will resume operations today. I am currently trying to find shipping agents that offers the best quotes and also trying to be assigned to 5 fulfillment centers but there has been an error on that saying my SKU is being used by another product. I am currently reaching out to amazon support and awaiting to hear back. So far I am trying to apply for my premium A+ content too but wouldn't want to move forward till this issue is resolved.
  - 2025-01-19 | Yes I placed the price in every spot but the price was missing. I might delete the listing and create a new one
  - 2025-01-03 | Okay got it
  - 2025-01-03 | Okay I do have the serial number for my trademark and might have not included it in the application. I'll make sure it is visible this time around <@1054411267340763216>
  - 2025-01-03 | What would be a good background image? Should I resume to ask the supplier for a higher resolution image with my logo on the product and packaging? Even though it's going to be photoshopped?
  - 2025-01-03 | <@1054411267340763216> Yes, attached below are my certificate and contract with the supplier. I copied the contract from the purchase history order of the sample product.
  - 2025-01-03 | <@1054411267340763216> hello brother, these are the images I uploaded on my first application and followed the steps from the brand registry module.
  - 2024-12-16 | The last two months were rough due to family matters, where I had to help out financially hence working almost everyday last half of october and most of november.
  - 2024-12-16 | Hello Jamie, thanks for reaching out.  I am awaiting to hear back from Trademark engine since they double charged me and have not provided the information I needed. Also said that USPTO fee was declined on their dashboard so trying to straighten that out. IP accelerator might not be ideal for my circumstance since I‚Äôm tight on budget.

As for my supplier, they gave me a great price for my product, including customized box logo, insert card and bundled item. Trying to see if I could also include another bundle item.
  - 2024-12-14 | No problem brother <@1054411267340763216>
  - 2024-12-14 | If not how do I get included in the channel?
  - 2024-12-14 | Hi guys, is the mastermind event for launched members only?
  - 2024-12-06 | Thanks
  - 2024-12-06 | Hi Jamie, I am currently in brand registry. I‚Äôm going to revisit the module where Minh teaches the brand registry. My question is I didn‚Äôt use IP accelerator and went on to file my trademark through Trademark Engine. What information or How would I file that through brand registry? <@1059659092475531444>
  - 2024-10-30 | Okay brother, thank you
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> , 

Sorry Idk why I didn‚Äôt get this notification but yea so I filed my trademark using a third party service like how I filed my llc through legalzoom. Just to save money and just having small issues back and forth. Overall just been slow process for me because I had to await samples and now feedbacks from friends/family. Once my trademark is straightened up, I will complete my brand registry
  - 2024-10-17 | Great, thanks

  - 2024-03-05 | Yea I thought about it too. But decided that it was a bit overkill so I went ahead with the quick USPTO search
  - 2024-02-15 | Probably just cause LegalZoom is kinda sketchy with how they present their services. A lot of their add ons when intiailly signed up for an LLC could be done for free or optional lol
But this sounds like one of those services that's worth spending money on to save you time. good suggestion, <@1112578451816321157>

  - 2024-11-28 | Hey guys! Happy thanksgiving! 
A few of my friends and I are putting a toy drive for the foster kids in LA. Even a football or small contribution goes a long way to possibly spark some inspiration to these kids! There‚Äôs strength in numbers so we would love any support! 

The whole goal is to pay it forward and give away what we want for ourselves. ü§ç

I know some of you aren‚Äôt in LA but we plan to take advantage of the Black Friday sale and you can ship it to me and I‚Äôll make sure it gets delivered! 

We will be collecting up until Dec 8th. I‚Äôll post up all the photos from our toy drives  for you guys! If you are interested pls reach out and I‚Äôll give you more information!!!  Thanks again <@975774205658411068> for just giving us the platform to win in all aspects in our lives!

  - 2025-02-15 | Waking up and seeing my dad getting fresh coconut water and storing it in a bottle for me makes me cry. For those who don‚Äôt know my story, my dad had a stroke during COVID, and the right side of his body is weak, but he still takes good care of me. There was a time when I didn‚Äôt talk to him for months because he was always busy, and I felt like he didn‚Äôt care about me. Now that I‚Äôve grown up, I realize that life means nothing if you don‚Äôt have time and freedom. I believe we are all here with the same goal‚Äîworking hard to regain our time for the ones we love. Let‚Äôs work harder everyone üòä

  - 2024-12-04 | Hi all, I want to share some tips part 2üòÇ 

If you've had your listing done but don't like it, or if you want to change it to match a seasonal theme on a short budget, or if you're having trouble finding a good listing agent to redo it, here's what I find helpful.

Ask your listing agent for all the product photos and 3D images (or any other images) with a white background.
(You can use a tool like PhotoRoom to remove the background, but for me, it's not ideal since it doesn't allow me to control what to keep or remove from the image.- still learning how to use it correctly)

Use Canva to edit or change the theme of your listing images, and/or RESIZE them for premium A+ content.

This way, you can save money and customize your listing exactly how you want it. Of course, you can't change the entire listing this way, but it can help you improve and update certain parts without breaking the bank. This is just an example but at least make listing image look more appealing
  - 2024-12-04 | For anyone newly launching a product on H10, I find the Xray Keywords feature extremely helpful. You can run Xray Keywords on competitor listings to find performance keywords that are generating sales for the product. By adding these keywords to your PPC campaigns, you can leverage competitor data to boost sales of your own product.
If you have the H10 Diamond Plan, you can also see the competitor's bids for each keyword, giving you even more insights to optimize your PPC strategy.

  - 2025-01-07 | Hi Shifu Team,

Hope you all had a wonderful start to the New Year!

I recently received an inquiry from a different brand interested in opening a wholesale account with me. I took a look at their online presence, and it seems they also have two storefronts on Amazon, selling in the same category but with completely different products.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to approach this. Should I move forward by making them an offer, or should I take a more cautious approach? What information should I ask for from them? What kind of contract should we set up? Should we include clauses about selling only on certain platforms or any other restrictions? Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences with this kind of situation!üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Can I use the chat as a record to file a claim? I‚Äôve been trying to resolve the issue with the supplier, but it‚Äôs taking too long and seems to be going nowhere. If I want to cancel the entire order because the supplier didn‚Äôt meet the requirements, and I want to get my money back, is that possible? Has anyone had a similar experience and filed a claim? What‚Äôs the likelihood of successfully filing a claim and getting a refund?

I am having trouble creating a variation and couldn't do it the traditional way. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they all advised me to create the variation through feeds. Has anyone done this before and can walk me through it, please? I'm not sure I understand what they're talking about.

  - 2024-11-11 | And about the negotiation <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-11 | üôèüèºüò¨
  - 2024-11-11 | And about storing goods in a 3PL warehouse and then shipping them to a nearby Amazon warehouse. I don‚Äôt understand if we order too much for small business like me. I can't generate enough cash flow because we have too much inventory in the warehouse. Also, is there really a significant difference between storing goods in an Amazon warehouse and a 3PL? Usually, we‚Äôre still able to sell those batches within three months to avoid extra fees on top? And those fees are tax write off. And during the holidays, even when we send inventory to Amazon, it still takes a while for them to receive it. So, what‚Äôs the benefit of storing in a warehouse and shipping to Amazon later?
  - 2024-11-11 | Is it normal to keep negotiating the price? I always negotiate the price down every time I place an order. I still want to maintain a good relationship and make sure I‚Äôm doing it right, at least ensuring they feel comfortable. When should we stop negotiating the price with the manufacturer?

  - 2025-02-15 | Hi everyone, I want to share tips for unsellable returned items-
You can donate items to charity and write them off as a tax deduction at the end of the year, regardless of the amount. For product accessories or bundled items, you can send them to customers as replacements for missing or broken parts. You can also create a new SKU and sell the bundled items/ parts as new, which can also help enhance your brand‚Äôs page or appearance- making it seem more established and trustworthy, rather than appearing as a new seller. It's better if your brand offers multiple products rather than just one.
  - 2025-02-02 | Hi Justin, I just watched all 4 videos above, and they are the same. I'm not sure if there are other videos we should watch, or if it's just one video?üôÇ

  - 2024-12-30 | <@536075832658231299> <@1066465177140215928>  I'm just curiousü§î . I see a listing with the tag 'Frequently Returned Item.' I'm wondering if we create a new condition under that ASIN/variation, which would give it a different SKU, the badge shouldn't appear on the variation anymore, right? Also, regarding all the shoppable items for that SKU/variation, would we still be able to keep them since it's considered a different SKU now?
  - 2024-12-29 | Hi hi hi, üëÄ I have recently received a few messages from buyers who scanned ManyChat code and wanted to leave a review in exchange for a gift. However, they can't leave a review because they received the product as a gift. What I did was tell them to leave a review as 'unverified,' since, for me, an unverified review still counts as long as it's a positive review.

Has anyone else experienced the same issue? Any other thoughts on this?ü§î
  - 2025-01-21 | Hi em <@1054411267340763216>  I‚Äôve noticed that many mentees didn‚Äôt know the mastermind was rescheduled due to the last event being canceled. I think a lot of them want to join the next one. Could you please repost the announcement on the main channel? üòÅ

  - 2025-01-17 | Because that one is not exactly the same
  - 2025-01-17 | I mean I want to change the item type keyword
  - 2025-01-17 | Hi everyone! I was wondering if you can change the subcategory of your listing ? It shows edit on the side but once I click another option it doesn‚Äôt update.
  - 2025-01-15 | Thank you Minh üòä
  - 2025-01-15 | Good morning everyone! I am preparing the FBA shipping label and I am at the last step printing the label and it appears in Chinese characters not just English. Is it correct or have I done some mistake? If anyone knows. Thank you‚Äô üôèüèª
  - 2025-01-28 | Hi everybody! I‚Äôm really asking for anyone who doesn‚Äôt live in USA. For fbm were you able to find anyone on fiver or somewhere to ship out the products for your orders??
  - 2025-01-28 | I‚Äôm not sure for me it‚Äôs a different amount for fba and fbm ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  - 2025-01-24 | Hi everyone! After a customer posts a question on the listing and you reply. How long after it shows on the listing? I‚Äôm afraid he might have asked me privately and not under Q&A on the listing page.
  - 2025-01-21 | Also do I have to do the shipping option from Amazon? Becuase when you buy shipping label you have to input the weight and the dimensions of the box
  - 2025-01-21 | Thank you so much <@1054411267340763216> since it‚Äôs fbm I cannot ship it from Canada? We aren‚Äôt that far.
  - 2025-01-21 | <@1054411267340763216> what do you advise I do now?
  - 2025-01-21 | So what should I do now? Make a new shipment? I‚Äôm also in Canada! Could I ship an empty box to them now? He placed order on Sunday but I already updated the tracking number with the empty envelope
  - 2025-01-21 | Good morning everyone! I am having an issue with an fbm order. I sent an empty envelope and apparently they scan it and they won‚Äôt deliver it since it‚Äôs empty. üò≥ so for now tracking number shows on hold. Does anyone had this experience?? What would you suggest me doing?
  - 2025-01-20 | Thank you Jamie üòä

  - 2025-02-07 | I would love to know this as well! I am planning on contacting him soon!
  - 2025-02-18 | Hi <@1066465177140215928> ! Just because i have asked the photographer to add the e book in the main picture. Could i do an existing book as e book and send them the link or does it have to be a new book? I wanted to add the atomic habits. Let me know if that‚Äôs not possible to put on hold the picture.
  - 2025-02-18 | Great advice, thank you
  - 2025-02-17 | 
  - 2025-02-17 | Hi Susan i am working on the Asins and have a question. There are some thermal printers but look a bit different and the sizing is different i am not sure if we should add them or not. I will attach pictures below. Let me know please! Thank you
  - 2025-02-17 | üôÇ
  - 2025-02-17 | thank you! I will work on the changes today
  - 2025-02-17 | Hi Susan! I cannot find the notes. Is it under direnct message here or on the email.
  - 2025-02-17 | For bids i need to add the amount for each word? I‚Äôm sorry i now started working on the keywords
  - 2025-02-17 | I will add those too
  - 2025-02-17 | Oh i thought that‚Äôs separate for the Asins
  - 2025-02-17 | Thank you Han I will make the change! Is there anything else to change?? I will also add the e book link. Do you think it should be at the beginning??
  - 2025-02-17 | thank you Han! I just sent it to messages! üôÇ
  - 2025-02-17 | Can i send you my Qr code to check the manychat as well?
  - 2025-02-17 | Okay thank you! I will send the keywords to Susan tomorrow morning!
  - 2025-02-17 | I also decided to add an ebook as an extra gift so that needs to show as well in the main picture
  - 2025-02-17 | The listing is ready but i am contacting the photographer for a few changes to make it better. The main picture mostly to become more attractive so people click on it!
  - 2025-02-17 | Oh i have the keywords but haven‚Äôt showed to Susan yet i was thinking this week to send them to her.
  - 2025-02-17 | Yes the order is in usa for custom clearance now
  - 2025-01-30 | Yes I see it now! Thank you!! üôèüèª
  - 2025-01-30 | Hi Susan! Sorry for the delay my kids are d husband are sick with fever ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  - 2025-01-26 | Thank you! üôèüèª

  - 2025-01-26 | Can we add a bow on the main picture to show that we have extra gifts as well?
  - 2025-01-24 | Hi everyone! After a customer posts a question on the listing and you reply. How long after it shows on the listing? I‚Äôm afraid he might have asked me privately and not under Q&A on the listing page.
  - 2025-01-24 | Thank you Han! I will contact them for the second batch! üôèüèªüòä
  - 2025-01-23 | Should I mention I am a student or a friend of Justin‚Äôs?
  - 2025-01-23 | Thank you for your super quick response! üôèüèªüòä
  - 2025-01-14 | I couldn‚Äôt find another video regarding manychat or warranty
  - 2025-01-14 | Under module 2-part 2 how to create/connect fb page to manychat bot by Justin
  - 2025-01-13 | Under which category is the manychat because the only video I saw was a short brief about manychat from Justin
  - 2025-01-13 | I have been looking but couldn‚Äôt find and YouTube is showing me some other stuff regarding amazons warranty
  - 2025-01-13 | Hi! So I am currently working on manychat and want to add the warranty so the customers can have access to it. Is there a video that shows how I can create a warranty certificate or something that they will receive to show the promise I have made for warranty?
  - 2025-01-13 | So happy to be back! ü§©
  - 2025-01-13 | Thank you Han üòä
  - 2025-02-14 | Even tho I had the kids and wasn‚Äôt able to concentrate 100% I got a lot of important information. 1- I‚Äôll try the other app he suggested instead of helium to gather keywords. 2- very important to note the most common mistakes people make prior to launching. I need to have a strategy, budget and timeline. I need to set realistic expectations as he mentioned and be patient let the data run before making any changes. Of course as all teachers have mentioned to optimise my listing so then to only have to focus on ppc and sales will naturally come!
  - 2025-02-13 | Thank you teachers for this amazing guest speaker! Even tho I had the kids couldn‚Äôt concentrate 100% I got a lot of important information! Will definitely re watch it! üôèüèªüòä‚ù§Ô∏è
  - 2025-02-13 | I‚Äôll be there thank you üôèüèªüòç
  - 2025-02-13 | Hi Minh! I have both kids with me tomorrow so I‚Äôm not sure how well I can listen to the guest speaker. Is there going to be a recording of the class?

  - 2024-10-27 | Hi Jamie! I've finished inventory #1 HW and will submit over as I'm still working on #2 and #3. For the data visibility.... my campaigns are set to start on Wednesday 10/30 so once I gather the data I will submit over but you said I can just submit once and update weekly right?

  - 2025-01-23 | Did anyone have this error in Manychat? I tried to insert row connected with Sheet, I already connected it in Integration. I google and they said this error because of something about Facebook Page I linked.

  - 2025-01-22 | Thanks for your advice sis, I'm waiting for that too üòâ

  - 2025-01-22 | Hi Minh, can you tag me on the tutorial for BOIR please? 
Also, I got my LLC done, working on trademark and logo now. Is it a good time to create dummy listing?

  - 2024-11-30 | I‚Äôm from Florida and just started this journey. I hope to find APs that the same journey and who we can learn from each other üòÑ
  - 2025-02-19 | I'm done with all the legal paperwork, I want to do the dummy listing, unfortunately, I'm out of the country and can't sign in to seller central now since it's required OPT. It's been a headache lately üò≠ I can only watching the module and working on Manychat and PPC now. 
I'm a little afraid the market will be changed when I'm ready to launch. I'll be back in states in 2 weeks.
  - 2025-02-11 | Will do Jamie!!
  - 2025-01-25 | Thank guys!
  - 2025-01-23 | Do I send the link invite to messenger of new page created under my Facebook to log in?
  - 2025-01-23 | Here is the new account I create under different email and assigned as editor. It shows in Team Member
  - 2025-01-23 | So I need to create another page under my FB and assigned to as editor? How can I do that because there are 2 places you can add member, 1 is Team Member 2 is in Manage Account?
  - 2025-01-23 | Yes, it show that I'm the owner and admin, I don't know how to change to editor so I create new account and invite to be editor. But not working either
  - 2025-01-23 | Can someone help me with this error, please?
  - 2025-01-06 | The suppliers asked me what's the shipping address for estimate time. They asked if it's Amz FBA? What's address Amz should I use?
  - 2025-01-05 | Oh great!! I'll talk to her when I'm able negotiate the price with suppliers.
  - 2025-01-05 | At the end, you got 300 units with customized packaging, Correct?
  - 2025-01-05 | So you got total 500 units but able to negotiate the price? Sorry about my confusion üòÖ
  - 2025-01-05 | Should I start working on brand registery and legal paperwork yet?
  - 2025-01-05 | I also working on the logo and packaging now, he‚Äôs my close friend working on logo and design as the side job and pretty good. I‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs meet my criteria or I‚Äôll hire the professional. 
I‚Äôm leaving to Vietnam in 3 weeks for 6 weeks vacation so I‚Äôm trying to the best I can while here. I‚Äôm still able to working on the project while on vacation but just making sure I got most of the important things done when I‚Äôm away.
  - 2025-01-05 | I don‚Äôt get it, so you paid 300 units and 200 packaging of them is customized and 100 wasn‚Äôt? 
Also, I negotiated with that one supplier and they agreed to stick the logo on the packaging/logo on the product for 300 units.
I want to ask what‚Äôs about the insert card and customize packaging, should I negotiate that with them too? How‚Äôs that work. Thanks for your help üôèüèª
  - 2025-01-04 | I got 1 supplier that looks trusted and good quality product, they accept customization such as logo and packaging but require MOQ is 1000 ü•≤ should I let it go or negotiate. My initial quantity is 200-300 so I don‚Äôt think I can negotiate that low.
Also, I messaged about 4 suppliers and waiting for their customization price and more detailed information.
  - 2025-01-04 | Nvm, I think I clicked send quotes instead of message the supplier ü§£ that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused
  - 2025-01-04 | Yes, I just ordered. Also I messaged the supplier on Alibaba and then I received instantly couple of messages from multiple supliers. So the message I sent wasn‚Äôt to specific supplier? The other suppliers doesn‚Äôt seem like have the model I want tho.
  - 2025-01-03 | Is it okay to analyze the review from TikTok Shop instead of Amazon? Because I don‚Äôt see much reviews on Amz
  - 2025-01-03 | Thanks Jamie!! I'll compare it and finalize everything. My questions are: 
* what's class should I attend to discuss about this? 
* what should I do first, talk with suppliers or create dummy listing (because you need some information from suppliers to create it)? 
I'm a little bit confused about what's steps should I do first üòÖ
  - 2024-12-31 | Hi all, I just wanted to check in about my progress with you guys. I‚Äôve been watching module 2 and sourcing along the side but I noticed some changes in the market:
* I checked the market today and see that there‚Äôs a new model (new mold) came out from different competitor and everyone loves it more than the old model. On Amazon, the product came out on December 14th, which is only couple weeks ago, and have 3 REVIEWS (all 5 stars)
* Also, the product came out with White color which is the idea I was gonna use with my product.
I‚Äôll try to innovate with some ideas but I‚Äôll appreciate if you guys have any advice for me. Should I be rush in since more competitor get into the market fast?
  - 2024-12-19 | Hi <@1054411267340763216>, I just submitted the 2nd product analysis. After last class and with your advices, I do consider go after the 1st product. But if you see the 2nd product better, I will consider about that. Also, after looking into the 1st product, I have found that:
* 1st product's COG would about $8-$10 with the improvement and logo. The 2nd product's COG would be about $20, which is double. 
* The top seller of 1st product sell it $35.99 with current sale to $32.99 PLUS $3 off. We didn't talk about this so I don't know if it'll be a problem.
Let me know what do you guys think! Thank you.
  - 2024-12-17 | Last week I was a little busy with the holiday and don't feel well so I didn't get much things done. But I'm still watching module for product analysis and doing product research. 

I was thinking send Minh my product analysis but the Google chart kind of caught me off (it's trendy product and new market). So, I'll discuss with Minh about that in class tonight and keep doing product research.
  - 2024-12-10 | Yes, I'll submit the pre-questions and homework file before the class starts
  - 2024-12-09 | I have 1 potential product and will discuss with Minh tomorrow on his class. I'm researching for more potential product üôèüèª
  - 2024-12-09 | Yeah but most the smaller market I found the top sellers won't have 100k revenue üòÖ
  - 2024-12-06 | Is it okay if the top seller doesn't have more than 10k reviews but the market does have sellers have more than 10k reviews (just not the top sellers) ?
  - 2024-12-06 | * does the top seller MUST have 100k? What if they close to100k?
* do you recommend product involved software app bundle? 
* when should I start set up LLC and biz credit card?
  - 2024-12-06 | I've been working on my product search, try to get used to with the Loop Research habit. 
I do have couple of questions but want to research more, work by myself until our next class meeting so I can discuss with you. 
I reached out to couple of our members for help and they gave great advices so I'll try it üòÅ
  - 2024-12-01 | Yes, I have it before joined the community so I just want to ask what should I do
  - 2024-11-30 | I also have Keepa and SellerAmp, does Helium 10 have all the features? Should I cancel those 2 too?
  - 2024-11-30 | Hi, I just watched the FBA Fee breakdown video and Susan (I think) talked about switching the account. I currently have Professional AMZ account, should I switch to Individual until I launched the product?
  - 2024-11-28 | Thank you!! So excited to joining the journey with you guys üòÅ

  - 2024-12-22 | I read we don‚Äôt have to do this right? Is this still required?
  - 2024-12-10 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-21 | I didn't wait so I can prepare for the first day of the sales tomorrow
  - 2024-11-20 | I tried and it still doesn't update the Title. I will try the delete and reupload spreadsheet method again after prime Week.
  - 2024-11-15 | Okay got it. Thank you
  - 2024-11-15 | Ah that was my mistake. I searched and used my original one.
  - 2024-11-15 | And you search your product right?
  - 2024-11-15 | This should be the spreadsheet that says ‚Äúadd a product that is already listed‚Äù?
  - 2024-11-15 | Okay I deleted it. I‚Äôll wait another 24 hours to redo it and upload a blank spreadsheet to see what red outline ones are needed
  - 2024-11-15 | I just went to inventory and somehow the spreadsheet created my listing. I still have the OLD title eventhough I uploaded a spreadsheet after 24 hours
  - 2024-11-15 | I am trying to upload the Spreadsheet and I have these 2 errors.
1. I put in my exact inventory. What would this require? or do I put 0?
2. Do I make a new SKU? I ran it with the SKU they provided, then I Ran another one with my old SKU. Both gave me these errors
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-13 | I see okay. I can do that
  - 2024-11-13 | okay. So delete first then reupload the spreadsheet? or vice versa?
  - 2024-11-13 | what about the current inventory that has the ASIN printed on them?
  - 2024-11-13 | this has to create a new ASIN?
  - 2024-11-13 | wouldn't it be a lot faster?
  - 2024-11-13 | curious to know why the "copy" listing doesnt work better?
  - 2024-11-13 | okay I will try that out
  - 2024-11-13 | correct
  - 2024-11-13 | or close it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Create a new one then delete the old one?
  - 2024-11-13 | no I dont have to
  - 2024-11-13 | and create a new listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | so I will update all the info and type it in
  - 2024-11-13 | but I didn't copy everything over. I just tried to refresh the current one
  - 2024-11-13 | I did it yesterday with the partial update
  - 2024-11-13 | Okay. I will do that
  - 2024-11-13 | Hmm so far out. Let me try to do it on my own first lol. So I can adjust it before this weekend
  - 2024-11-07 | I wasn‚Äôt able to attend his class yesterday so I didn‚Äôt get a chance to send anything in yet. 

I am still in the process of moving  some of my work schedules around for the weekly meeting

  - 2025-02-20 | ü´° yes boss
  - 2025-02-20 | Yes exactly we have to test and see what works and what doesn‚Äôt. At the end we learn more and keep on improving
  - 2025-02-20 | PS I‚Äôm  not a PPC master
  - 2025-02-20 | If I see I can put in more budget I will turn on asin campaign and so on.
  - 2025-02-20 | In summary the key takeaways from this class were:
1. when launching focus on exact kws campaign because they are the ones who help you rank organically. Max 10 KW per category as much campaigns as you need depending on your product. 
2. Every kw needs time to be tested , so 10/day budget and see which is a bleeder. Basically test and proven campings 
3. Don‚Äôt do SB videos until you gain organic sales. But at the end he says not necessary 
4. Focus on ranking organically as fast as possible. After ranking can distribuir the budget for board ohrase and other campaigns 
5. Use the search query report to look at what customers are searching for 
6. -15% of suggested bid and bids down

So taking in consideration of this , I created 3 more exact campaigns with 10/day and see how it goes. Also from my first launch I looked at my spends on each campaign and took out everything that‚Äôs not converting and only left the ones that sold. Only since budget it‚Äôs tight I only have my broad and phrase and exact campaign which are the ones that covert the most for my case from first launch plus the 3 new exact campings.
  - 2025-02-20 | I know ! I ran out of friends to help  and I don‚Äôt want to ask more mentees scared that everyone will buy the products and leave reviews and Amazon will catch up. I looking to work with Larry but it‚Äôs so expensive
  - 2025-02-20 | February, 19, 2025
Today I partially relaunched. I‚Äôm trying new methods of PPC, eager to get insights from this. I had 2fbm sales and 1 ff posted a review. Also my fb group has 20+ followers and one good review.  Still working on shippable videos. I‚Äôm happy today I sold 2 units without ads and at higher price. I also encourage everyone to put coupon if you haven‚Äôt . They bring visibility and 50% don‚Äôt apply the coupon which is a win ü•á. Working to officially launch this week or early next week. 

My goals :
1. get one more FBM sales
2. By the end of week have 2 shop able.m videos
3. Have new listing images
  - 2025-02-20 | Phuong how do you get so many fbm sales?
  - 2025-02-19 | SO EXCITED !! LETS SELL!!
  - 2025-02-17 | February 17,2025
Working to make new listing images before relaunching. Finishing influencers videos. Ready with PPC‚úÖ 
Almost done and additional ebook I made for added value.
  - 2025-02-16 | February 16, 2025
Today I have time to work on pending things. 
I already have 50 sth units available. I listened to Bernard PPC class and will test his methods as well as continue our proven methods. For board and phrase campaigns I took out all that‚Äôs not converting and left the proven ones. Lowered budget for auto campaigns and turned off most Asins not converting and leaving only the ones that do. And left ultimate on as usual. Lastly created a new test campaign for exact Kws to try this new method with new keywords from search query report and set bid to 85% suggested bid. Working on how to distribute budget to all these so I don‚Äôt overspend and I could earn some profit for this batch and reducing refunds order by optimizing listing images
  - 2025-02-16 | Olesia I thought you launched already ?
  - 2025-02-12 | The type of email I was waiting for üî•
  - 2025-02-12 | February 12,2025
Being able to edit 2 more videos for social media. Created 2 more ebooks to that value for relaunch. Working with 3PL for more reviews, it‚Äôs a lot of money üò≠üò≠. My inventory is in transit , soon will relaunch
  - 2025-02-11 | February 10, 2025
My second batch is in transit statusüî• so exciting. Currently still working with influencers and how I will rotate that unit to all of them. Hopefully can get a solution this week. Also working for third batch and talking with 3pl for returns
  - 2025-02-06 | Hello Hannah, in my experience I think vine reviews are a great way to get  reviews as long as you believe your product is good quality. Because that‚Äôs the whole point we trying to bring value to our customers. And for me I could only send in 2 units for vine because I was already close to the 30 reviews at that time. And from them I got one five and one four star which I think it‚Äôs pretty good. Also shifu Justin also said we can create separate listing to send another 30 reviews and then merge them together to add the reviews which I will definitely do really soon. So key take away a if you believe your product is good then I encourage you to do it ( and of course you have to give out the product )
  - 2025-02-03 | February 2, 2025
So I manage to edit two videos of the 3 I filmed. Also got two fbm reviews. Lastly, next week will have start to sending products for influencers and prepare for relaunch.

  - 2025-01-17 | For you it‚Äôs important to keep the kw ranking for the coming batch so you don‚Äôt loose momentum

  - 2025-01-23 | Wow that‚Äôs a nice one, I have to do that too
  - 2025-01-22 | I will suggest placing bulk order after getting brand registry approved. This way you are sure the production with the logo on product don‚Äôt have to be changed after. Also important steps such as the contract signed, warranty , quality specified, as described in the vault
  - 2025-01-15 | As Phuong said , I also recommend Susan and her husband. Before placing order make sure you have the contract signed stipulating  all important points regarding shipping , warranty , quality etc.

  - 2024-10-28 | Hello <@536075832658231299> , I am optimizing my PPC manually so I can learn better before using the PPC tool, i have 7 days of data, can you help me check them to see if my new bid is suitable?I want to manage bleeders and increase bids where is due
  - 2024-11-22 | Ok ! Thank you
  - 2024-11-21 | this is for ppc practice 4
  - 2024-11-21 | <@536075832658231299> can you helpme with this highlighted example? the impressions are low but the clicks are high. My guess is to lower just a bit because the acos is still high but not so much because there is not much impressions
  - 2024-11-14 | üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªthank you
  - 2024-11-05 | Should we just take out this kw?
  - 2024-11-05 | And what if I already set bid to be 0.20, still not generation sales but spending 100+ , what should be we in this case ?
  - 2024-11-05 | <@536075832658231299> for example, if there is 30 clicks, no sales and the cpc Is lower than the suggested bid, why do we want to keep it the same ?
  - 2024-11-18 | Ok will work on that
  - 2024-11-18 | I am also trying to run another coupon with the new price of 99.99 by offering 5% discount, but the system won‚Äôt allow because now the price with coupon is 94.99 and they want it to be 92.14 because it was the lowest price with coupon before the change. Does this mean I cant put coupon unless I want to lower it to 92.14?
  - 2024-11-18 | Hello shifus, should I worry about the return rate ?
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok I will still analyze the ranking of kws
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok will do
  - 2024-11-15 | Ok
  - 2024-11-15 | 96.99

  - 2025-01-19 | The fbm will show on the left side(bottom) as other sellers. When you do an FBM, you need to instruct them to go to other sellers and choose the one that's $129.99. <@1271018123725770762>

  - 2025-01-25 | That must have been so stressful. I also tried negotiating for 30days payment but the supplier's response was like I was asking for something so absurd. Ahahahah. How'd you negotiate?

  - 2024-04-25 | I already got my business name. Question: Do I place ***"Business name" Pty Ltd*** as my Amazon store or I can just use the business name without Pty Ltd?
  - 2024-10-23 | Ok. Thanks Susan.
  - 2024-10-23 | Will it make a difference on relaunch if I slow down my sales? Lower my PPC bids? I will still be sold out before the 2nd batch arrives.
  - 2024-10-08 | Got it! Thanks for A++ advice. üòä
  - 2024-10-08 | I am running out of budget on 2 of my campaigns, I have increased it and still running out. Do u suggest increasing still? I have 14 sales since prime day started.
  - 2024-10-07 | Ok. Like right now, with the price I am selling. I have 30% profit margjn. If I give 20% off it would be around 20% profit margin. Do you recommend increasing the price a little bit so when you do a 20% discount, the profit margin would be around 25%?
  - 2024-10-06 | When doing prime sales, how much profit margin are you guys willing to go down to?
  - 2024-09-29 | the one that looks like this?
  - 2024-09-29 | ok. thanks Engel. Do you have a link to the PPC optimization sheet?
  - 2024-09-29 | +ppc optimization sheet. Or is there a place where it is stored and we can just download it?
  - 2024-09-29 | Can I have the link to the ppc tracking sheet pls
  - 2025-02-09 | It is like an FBA order. So Amazon does everything from packing to sending. It takes it from your inventory.
  - 2025-02-08 | 
  - 2025-02-08 | Hi Carolina. With MCF order, you make an order through your seller central and send your own product to someone.
  - 2025-01-30 | Are they able to provide you an order number? Because in the warning it says "we have limited this product to VERIFIED purchase reviews". Maybe someone shared your insert card to scan so they can get a gift card. Just my thoughts.
  - 2025-01-29 | There are 2 agents provided and vouched. Macy and Elinor. I have tried both, I suggest you go with Macy's as they provide tracking and they are a little bit cheaper than Elinor's one. You can ask her to give you a quote for shipping to 2 or 5 warehouses and see which one is cheaper. You can ask your supplier as well for a quote and then compare.
  - 2025-01-29 | This was 1000 units. üòä
  - 2025-01-24 | No. I ordered the extras and had it sent to the US together with the other shipments
  - 2025-01-23 | Yup. I ask the supplier to send extra add-ons and insert cards as well
  - 2025-01-23 | Or send them back to AMZ warehouse after repacking
  - 2025-01-23 | You can just repack them. Ask your supplier to send you your product box so you can sell them as FBM.
  - 2025-01-23 | Negotiate with your supplier and place it in your contract that if ever there are defective units,  you can just take a video of the  defect and send it to them. Then they will credit on your nexr order. It took me a lot of negotiation until they said yes to that.

  - 2024-08-23 | There is a new feature " suggested daily budget". Do we go with that budget for now? (launching soon)
  - 2024-10-30 | Yes!!! Is there a bonus free subscription? Asking for a friend.
  - 2025-01-14 | Well, anyway, I will do what you have advised. Lower the price so it sells first. Thanks Han.
  - 2025-01-14 | But with the warning they gave me, they said FNSKU should start with XOO. That is why I jad problems with Inbound shipment.
  - 2025-01-14 | Yes, I did it on the exact listing but the FNSKU they sent me to print had the ASIN on it, not the FKSKU. That's what was placed on the box.
  - 2025-01-14 | I was wondering why the FNSKU looked different. When I sent them before(1st batch) it was XOO...
  - 2025-01-14 | I was given a notification that I used a wrong label. But when I pressed print label I was given this.
  - 2025-01-14 | Hello???Help?? ü•∫üôè
  - 2025-01-13 | Hi. I just got a few questions about my listing and my inventory.

Backstory:
- sold out for almost 3months
- added a color variation: now selling beige and brown
- relaunched on the 7th January
- inventory is still slowly coming in

1. I sent inventory to my child listing(beige)‚Ä®ASIN: B0D7DQZRYM‚Ä®SKU: GX-T88S-TYUK‚Ä®‚Ä®Somehow, some of my inventory is going into the old listing> ASIN: B0D7DQZRYM  ‚Ä®SKU: NS-5C1F-LU2O‚Ä®‚Ä®As you can see, there are 5 available units(FBA) in that listing. Only one of that is a return from last month I think. The rest just suddenly appeared.‚Ä®‚Ä®I have chatted with Amazon help desk but they can‚Äôt review the shipment as the status is still receiving until now.‚Ä®‚Ä®Is there a way I should deal with it?‚Ä®
2. Should I reactivate the listing and close it after it sells out? Or should I just send it to a warehouse and then close the listing.‚Ä®
3. Can I delete this listing as well?‚Ä®> ASIN: B0DNV38SH7
      SKU: XC-IQCP-DVO6

Hoping to hear from you guys soon.
  - 2024-12-09 | it is there now!!! thanks for your help <@536075832658231299> <@308107877493768193>
  - 2024-12-09 | I'll try that
  - 2024-12-09 | Okay, thanks
  - 2024-12-09 | It is still not showing the variation on the listing but the reviews are showing up on the brown now.
  - 2024-12-07 | And this is the one we just made?
  - 2024-12-07 | This is the one I need to delete, right? this is the one one as it is still FBA.
  - 2024-12-07 | 
  - 2024-12-07 | it still does not show the variation on the listing
  - 2024-12-07 | is this correct now? do I need to change it to FBA?
  - 2024-12-07 | <@536075832658231299> this is how the new listing looks like
  - 2024-12-06 | Hi Han. Please send me the link to the call when you are ready. Thanks
  - 2024-11-28 | Booked!! Thanks Han
  - 2024-11-28 | Can I just schedule a call with you so this can be sorted out please. Thank you,
  - 2024-11-28 | that is how the listing looks like when I do "edit listing"
  - 2024-11-28 | I just wanted to see how the SKU parent/child relationship. This looks ok right? I don't need to do anything else?
  - 2024-11-28 | I have not changed anything from when I first made it. Do I need to make any changes?
  - 2024-11-27 | is that correct?
  - 2024-11-27 | yes
  - 2024-11-27 | it's not this one?
  - 2024-11-27 | or night. üòÑ
  - 2024-11-27 | ok. Thanks Han. Have a great day.
  - 2024-11-27 | does this mean it has been resolved?
  - 2024-11-27 | 
  - 2024-11-27 | I just acknowledged the violation then they sent me the email below
  - 2024-11-27 | that is what comes out when I click the variation
  - 2024-11-26 | this is how my listing looks like. same as yesterday. I don't know what listing they deleted as it still looks the same.
  - 2024-11-26 | and acknowledged the violation. Is there anything else I need to do?
  - 2024-11-26 | 
  - 2024-11-26 | I went to "account health"
  - 2024-11-26 | Just received this email. It says there's a duplication of the listing( Parent/Child). It also says the listing has been removed. When I check my listing, the parent/child are still there. I am not sure what to do about this.
  - 2024-11-24 | thank you so much <@536075832658231299> for your help. ‚òùÔ∏è
  - 2024-11-24 | i just had a read online. there needs to be available inventory for the variations to show on your listing. all good then.
  - 2024-11-24 | How do I make my lsiting look like this?? where it shows a ll the shoppable colors in the ad.
  - 2024-11-24 | nevermind. all good. both listings came out after a few minutes.
  - 2024-11-24 | But it show as 2 variations
  - 2024-11-24 | I submitted but only one child(brown) is under the parent
  - 2024-11-23 | I have just saved it into drafts for now
  - 2024-11-23 | I tried submitting but there was an error. What should I place on the SKU?
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-23 | 
  - 2024-11-22 | I have made a new listing and sent the new FNSKU for brown variation to the supplier
  - 2024-11-22 | Will it make a new asin and not connect to the old reviews? Or it connects once parent listing is made and placed together?
  - 2024-11-22 | Ok. Will do step 1.
  - 2025-01-06 | I have never heard of this. üòµ‚Äçüí´ noooo

  - 2025-02-07 | Hello I just finished watching module 2 Part 3 and was wondering if I must have missed a tutorial on getting a trademark? and setting up LLC. I just ordered my samples and am quite lost on timeline of what to do first. I watched the module about brand registry and was kind of lost when I didn't know that a trademark was supposed to be filed. Thank you for all the help üôÇ

  - 2024-02-24 | I guess when the demand increase, they will increase their price too. Or maybe because we use them to open the LLC, so they can have a different price for us?! But im sure they know how to make money.
  - 2024-02-15 | I just let legalzoom did that for me. 49$

  - 2024-10-21 | okay, thank you!
  - 2024-10-21 | Hey <@536075832658231299>, the PPC is the PPC assistant form right?
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, thank you for yalls help! Gotta head back to work
  - 2024-10-11 | I just sent a polite email stating feedback edits because he said what edits do I want from this morning. He said "people get the jest of the product from what I showed, and if i add anymore stuff it'll drop my audiences retention and views.
  - 2024-10-11 | I mean he had a list of things to highlight, because this is a paid one. He highlighted nothing and mentioned incorrect information on the video! He didn't mention one thing and says on the video "I'm not going to connect that right now because I don't have time"
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | he doesnt even have the correct stuff while talking about it
  - 2024-10-11 | yea the post is so crappy haha, we had told him what to feature and he did none put just pretty much plugged it in and turned it on. Then showed my bundles
  - 2024-10-11 | haha yeah
  - 2024-10-11 | im just so annoyed of him
  - 2024-10-11 | We also gave him the option to opt out when we had to update the software, he said he will wait.
  - 2024-10-11 | I'm going to send this to him because he's being childish and had several emails today stating how hard he has worked. And he said its been sitting in his draft box since Tuesday and just forgot to send till this morning. Lies. 

We apologize for the initial pause in production due to the software update, and we appreciate your patience in waiting for the new version to arrive. However, despite the agreed-upon deliverable dates, there have been ongoing delays. We understand that you sent the video this morning after we had already communicated our decision to part ways and requested a refund. Although you mentioned the video was recorded earlier in September, the timestamp on our product, which displays real-time, shows today's date, 10/11/24. We will accept this video and conclude our sponsorship following its submission. Thank you for your time, and we wish you the best in your future endeavors.
  - 2024-10-11 | thank you both for your inputs, ppl are shitty haha
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, yeah makes sense
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah, that's what im afraid of
  - 2024-10-11 | or have people buy and post lots of 1 review
  - 2024-10-11 | hahah
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont like him either haha, that's why i wanted to dispute but he seems childish and I dont want backlash
  - 2024-10-11 | Just wanted to see if you advice disputing or taking a loss to prevent backlash? Has this happened to you before?
  - 2024-10-11 | and he keeps emailing saying he wont refund becuase he put so much work into this
  - 2024-10-11 | I sent the request for refund to keep it cordial and he sent a crappy video this morning. He said we wont refund because he has spent hours and hours working on this. My device on the video shows a time stamped he recorded it this morning
  - 2024-10-11 | service
  - 2024-10-11 | Help! Wanted to ask for any advice on this situation Im currently experiencing. I have an influencer I'm working with, paid a deposit already. He was suppose to post a video in august and he kept delaying and not responding. He finally responded in sept when we asked to part ways and get a refund. He said his technician has been on vacation and he couldn't get the recordings done and will be able to have it done be 9/20. 9/21 came and he delayed it again. Multiple follow ups every other day and no response. Yesterday we sent another letter to part ways due to it past deadline again and he said he will send it today at noon. I still wanted to part ways bc its past my prime day and wanted it before then. He got upset and said he is not refunding something hes spent hours and hours on. He sent a video this morning and the time stamp shows he recorded it this morning and sent it to me 30 mins after he finished recording. I sent a refund request and he denied it even though the video is terrible. Would you still file a dispute on paypal or take a loss?

  - 2024-12-23 | just submitted it again earlier today from a different computer system so I am hoping this one is right. Please let me know if there were any problems.
  - 2024-12-19 | i submitted it again and I used a numbers to .csv converter. I am hoping it is right this time. Thanks.
  - 2024-12-18 | thats really weird. I am definitely not converting it to a .numbers document and I have no clue why it is automatically downloading like that. When I save it to my downloads it says .csv. I promise I am just exporting from amazon saving it to my downloads and uploading in the PPC Assistant form, so it has to be downloading wrong. I can try to use a converter to change the document back to .csv. Do you think that will work? Thanks.
  - 2024-12-16 | I resubmitted PPC assistant and tried dragging the files instead of uploading. I didnt change anything from what was downloaded from Amazon. Please let me know if this is still screwed up or if it is good now. Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-12-13 | would it work to submit a screenshot or do I need to keep it in the .csv file? Not sure why the above error is happening. Have you had this happen with anyone else before? Thanks.
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | when I save it it says .csv but and it shows the following table (first pic) but when I upload it to ppc assistant form and open it, it displays as the 2nd pic. Is this what you are seeing on your end? Not sure where the error is happening. I am downloading from amazon and uploading to the ppc assistant form without changing anything.
  - 2024-12-11 | Thanks Susan, I just submitted my documents for PPC assistant. I am really doing bad on ACOS on the ASIN campaign. I am not sure exactly what is causing it to do so poorly. Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi Han,
My targeting tab on amazon ads is still showing the "temporarily removed sponsored display data from this page" message. I would like to use PPC assistant but cant download any files. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can bypass this? Do you think if I call the amazon team they can help with this?  Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-12-06 | sounds good. I will wait for that to be fixed then submit my PPC Assistant. Thanks.
  - 2024-12-04 | 
  - 2024-12-04 | hi Han,
when I went to the targeting tab I got the following error message and when I exported my data from the last 2 weeks I got this document with no impressions. Have you ever seen this "removed sponser display data" note before? Do I just have to wait until amazon fixes it to export a document with real data? Thanks!
  - 2024-11-13 | nevermind, susan let me know she was the one who looked at my keyword research. Thought that was you Han. Sorry about that. Ill see you on Friday for our 1 on 1 meeting. Thanks.
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Han, I submitted my PPC keyword analysis and got the attached email back with no coaching comments. Did you or someone else get a chance to look at this? I am going to schedule a 1 on 1 meeting in your calendar. I have my 5 reviews made just waiting for them to load onto my account so I believe my listing is ready for launch besides the video I still need. Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-11-11 | I apologize. I was out of town in North Carolina for work the last 6 days and didn't have much access to discord or work on my product at all. I just sent Han my PPC Keyword research and am going to schedule a call once I get my 5 FBM review loaded onto my listing. I will try to keep up on the homework this week.

  - 2025-02-18 | Hi AMZ Fam,

It‚Äôs been a while since I have been active and wanted to pop in to hopefully get back on track. I lost my job recently so we are going through a transition period as we figure out how to adjust. It‚Äôs been pretty difficult as I‚Äôve never lost a job before. I have been taking this time to be with my family and getting my mind right to refocus on what‚Äôs next. 

These are definitely trying times but I‚Äôm going to push myself.

Goals this week
1) Focus on mental
2) reconnect with suppliers on samples
3) reorder samples for samples that have been lost in mail :/
  - 2025-02-01 | I‚Äôve received a couple of my samples, unfortunately lost a couple as well. The suppliers are out for CNY, so I will wait until they are back in business to reorder the samples. In the meantime as I wait I could work on trying out the samples and brand registry. This week I also reached out to my suppliers to wish them a happy new year!
  - 2025-02-01 | Sorry to hear Chloe! Hope you are okay!

  - 2024-12-11 | 1. Never doubt yourself. You are more capable than you think.

2. Spend time building meaningful relationships and learn as much as you can (Although I believe you should never stop learning)

3. Invest in yourself, your mental, and take care of yourself well. Only you can love yourself the most. ‚ô•Ô∏è
  - 2024-12-04 | Sorry to hear your'e not feeling well. Get well soon!

  - 2025-02-01 | Has the venue changed as well?
  - 2025-01-08 | Congratulations Olesia!! You are amazing and keep up the great work! <@1230862203146473472>
  - 2024-12-18 | Sad I would have to miss out. I already have family plans at the same time. Have fun everyone!!

  - 2025-02-19 | Hi Jamie,

Thanks for checking in. I recently lost my job so have been going through that. As for the AMZ process, I have received a couple samples and working on a couple reorders for samples as they got lost during shipment around the CNY.
  - 2024-12-22 | 
  - 2024-12-22 | please see corrected calculation below
  - 2024-12-22 | Sorry I think I did caluclation wrong on FBA
  - 2024-12-22 | 
  - 2024-12-22 | Can you check the profit calculation for me please?
  - 2024-12-22 | This is for my other product
  - 2024-12-22 | Hi <@1054411267340763216>
  - 2024-12-16 | On Amazon it‚Äôs selling for 59.99. I just marked mine down a little lower to 55.99 to see
  - 2024-12-16 | I also sent in another product analysis and pending review. üôèüèº hopefully that can be potential product
  - 2024-12-16 | 
  - 2024-12-16 | Hi Jamie,

Happy Monday and thank you for reaching out. I started to work on my profit calculation for the item Minh reviewed for product analysis up top. I just wanted to make sure I did this correctly.
  - 2024-12-06 | That's amazing! Thank you for reaching out, I really appreciate the support. I will send you an invite to connect. I think most of my struggles come with time management with work and juggling family-life.
  - 2024-12-06 | Hi Jamie,

Thanks for checking in. I hope you‚Äôre doing well also. üôÇ I am in my 2nd month of product research and feeling like I‚Äôm running out of ideas and places to look. What stage are you in?
  - 2025-01-12 | Love the shirts!

I will go with another product back up because the current one that number has changed a lot. I will order sample now, prepare everything for lauching after Luna New Year.
  - 2025-01-09 | Do u have some suggestions  about this?
  - 2025-01-09 | Ok, so I will write down the questions here.
  - 2025-01-09 | Hi <@536075832658231299> , so now I am working on trademark and listing. I know you are busy with Mastermind event now. After this, could we make a call for my first bulk order?
  - 2025-01-08 | Market is about 1 million
  - 2025-01-08 | Ok. For example, I will sell the light for garden. All of products on Amazon now use battery. my sample is still light for garden but use solar. And it is not on Amazon now.
  - 2025-01-08 | The important things is this product is a new on Amazon (means it never had on Amazon now) how can I know what is a good prices for selling?
  - 2025-01-08 | Hi <@536075832658231299> , I change the sample that go with solar and battery. So do I need to register with Amazon?
  - 2025-01-08 | Got it. Thank so much!
  - 2025-01-07 | Hi <@536075832658231299>  I got sample. I like it. So now could u help me what do u need prepare now?
  - 2025-01-06 | I will be there. See u!
  - 2025-01-06 | Happy New Year Year <@536075832658231299> , I am back.  I am still waiting the sample. It is a solar one but it have battery for saving the energy so it takes longer for shipping. It should be here in 01/08.
I should to share with you, I am really want to be success in SHIFU course. I changed my minde and my habits when I focus my time with this community. But, I have a nail salon, It is really busy on Holiday and Summer, I am tired after working. So  I cant keep constant time in here. I am stuck. Can I talk with you or Justin for get some advices?
  - 2024-12-22 | Good morning <@536075832658231299> , I am busy on Holiday with my shop and I take vacation for whole next week. The Sample will be here on next Thursday. I think about the desgin package? or just leave it now.
  - 2024-12-14 | Good morning <@536075832658231299> , I were working with 2 products that I am really like. But one of them have customer who has signed up for underwriting deals on the US Amazon platform, so they can not sale this model to US Amazon seller anymore. I order the left one. Will be here next week. I will learn video from Shifu course when I am waiting the sample.
  - 2024-12-10 | Good morning <@536075832658231299> , After looking for products with prices that stand out from the others, I got the sample, but the sample is not good enough to compare with a competitor. It is similar to the big brand names on the market. They have a good outfit, and the design package is so professional. So now I am looking for another one that has a design that is not on the market now, and they have new technology that uses solar instead of batteries. Today, I will order the sample.
  - 2024-12-05 | The others sample, 1 have design never has in this market, and one have the newest feature like solar instead battery.
  - 2024-12-05 | Of course,  the first sample, I just focused on the price and smart features. Actually, it is an one still good on market now but I dont like the design and colors it is not professional.
  - 2024-12-05 | Alright. Thanks Han.
  - 2024-12-05 | while I am waiting another samples? what should I do prepare for next steps?
  - 2024-12-05 | Do I need do trademark now?
  - 2024-12-05 | I need some advices? Could u give me some?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi <@1059659092475531444> actually I got my first sample yesterday but I dit not like it. So now I order the other one and will have plan do trade mark.
  - 2024-12-05 | Could u give me a time for call! I need to tell you my progress!
  - 2024-12-05 | So can I call u?
  - 2024-12-05 | You make my day!

  - 2025-01-29 | Hi Han! Justin mentioned I should reach out more for help, can we schedule a call? I'm experiencing 60% return rate and based on my selling direct to people on Facebook, many don't understand what the CarPlay product does, and also the product is not compatible with many cars.

I think I'd like to explore PPC and listing optimization and/or liquidation options. Thank you!

  - 2025-02-16 | Sent in Product Analysis form to Minh and then Han with getting not so great feedback to go for the products I chose. Back to square one and product research again. Revisited old product analysis sheets and found one that may have potential. Going to run it by Minh. Re-watching modules and familiarizing myself with everything again. Hopefully I am not stuck back at square one for long again üôÑ
  - 2025-02-15 | If someone judged you for intending to learn from a millionaire then they need to do a self-check üòÇ
  - 2025-02-09 | Goals for last week:

- Go over new product and sent in analysis to Minh
- Looked at more potential add-ons for product
- Attended Susan‚Äôs class and got advice about remaining straggler units of last product
- Beginning the process of rewatching old Shifu tutorials and watching some new tutorials in the vault

All goals were met and am slowly getting back into the beginning steps of a new product
  - 2025-02-06 | Oooo good idea!
  - 2025-02-05 | Yeah I thought so, dang
  - 2025-02-05 | You have to send an actual product to those doing the Vine reviews, is that right Hannah?
  - 2025-02-01 | Omg! I just noticed this now! Awww. So glad everyone is safe Chloe. Did your car get totaled?
  - 2025-01-29 | I think I have finally settled on a new product and I am now just waiting for samples when everyone gets back from holidays. I‚Äôve already thought of some cool add-ons and I‚Äôm starting to plan out other first steps for re-launch. I started a new job which is very close to home and on regular day shift! Yay! I‚Äôm back to the land of the living üòÇ Only downside is now I can‚Äôt attend any classes anymore ü´§ And getting around to rewatching recorded classes is going to be difficult with the long days at work and with using up any free time to go over old tutorial videos in the Shifu vault *sigh* Can‚Äôt win them all I guess

  - 2025-02-21 | Hi <@1054411267340763216>, question for you - if we come across a product that checks all the boxes of being a potential one to go after but they can range in weight from 2lbs to 5lbs, should we still avoid it?

  - 2025-02-16 | Thanks for the real estate advice Justin
  - 2025-02-16 | Thanks dear ü•∞
  - 2025-02-16 | I was looking at this one!! ü§£
  - 2025-02-16 | Ok thanks dear ü•∞
  - 2025-02-16 | Which one do you use Olesia?
  - 2025-02-16 | I've never heard of it! I'm gonna look that up
  - 2025-02-16 | Same, I have to dye my roots every 3-4 weeks. But I dye my hair black and blue so the roots show really easily
  - 2025-02-16 | I have lots of grey hair too üòû
  - 2025-02-16 | I hear so many different things! Last I heard about retinol was that it can cause inflammation but I don't get that when I use it on my neck
  - 2025-02-16 | I've never heard of sculptra, is that a procedure? I was going to look into Morpheus8, its a skin tightening procedure. But I don't know how well it is for crow's feet. It's expensive too though. I've never tried retinol around the eye area. I only retinol on my neck
  - 2025-02-16 | Honestly, eventually Botox. You can help with a good skincare routine but in the end, you'll end up getting them no matter what. I use hyaluronic acid serums and try to keep my face from drying out by drinking lots of water. Moisturizers just give me acne so I use a face cream that has hyaluronic acid in it and then use pure 100% hyaluronic acid on it after as well. But I also do Botox which prevents any wrinkle lines from getting more pronounced and deeper. But its expensive and you have to keep doing it every 4-6 months
  - 2025-02-16 | Eeeeeeeeeeee!! Nice date you have there! Flowers and everything!!

  - 2024-11-04 | Hi <@536075832658231299> , I am just going over the homework for next week and I re-watched the recording but I am confused about which example question you are referring to that you want us to do for our homework for next week. Was it example 10 from our previous homework assignment that you want us to answer those questions with?

  - 2025-01-05 | Grrrr. That‚Äôs just downright obnoxious üò°
  - 2025-02-09 | Ok thank you <@1054411267340763216> I know the fees are high. That was one of my concerns. But I have also noticed that the fees have been high for basically everything now. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just Amazon or what. But everything just seems to be high in fees. I can‚Äôt quite do a profit margin yet as I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from Macy about more prices when everyone is back from CNY. So I will let you know what I calculate
  - 2024-12-12 | Yeah and when I clicked on it, nothing came up under FC transfer or processing. It must be orders that are waiting to be shipped like you were saying
  - 2025-01-12 | So jealous!!! üòî  I hope we can all meet at the other mastermind event!
  - 2025-01-12 | Woot woot!! I'm gonna plan for this!
  - 2025-01-09 | 
  - 2025-01-09 | I guess it was my turn guys, flight cancelled üòû

  - 2025-01-15 | Hi AMZSHIFU WARRIORS! It's been a while and I had to put my work here on pause since December. I have been busy traveling and finalizing the sale of my software business, and on top of that, I'm dealing with health issues that I'm working to overcome. It's been very challenging. But I'm committed to getting my product launched. I have samples and products to bundle that I think will add substantial value and stand out. I need to work on packaging design and work towards being ready to place my order. I could use some advice on where my primary focus should be and what classes I should attend to help achieve my goal of launching in a few weeks. What insights can you provide to help reset my focus? Any help would be appreciated.This community is the best. I hope to give back and offer my insights as I become more experienced in this journey. Feel free to reply here or DM me directly <@337800821049917442> . Thank you üôè

  - 2025-02-01 | A. Reflection:

I felt like I did pretty well this week, but there are areas I still need to improve on..
+ Went to the gym 5 times so far and planning to walk on the treadmill for 1h tomorrow.
+ I've finished module 1 and am moving onto week 2's checklist items.
+ Reading atomic habits.
 
- I'm having trouble staying awake after work. I usually feel very drained after work and then I come home, set an alarm for a quick nap but sleeps through them.
- Then I use my phone and doom scroll through reels or friend's stories at the end of the night because I can't fall asleep.
- Distracted by my phone to reply to my friends and family.

Resolutions:
I could delete instagram and just move the texting friends and family on Facebook.
I could drink coffee to keep myself awake until 9/10 PM to sleep at the right time.

My WHYs: 
To be financially free, and be able to support myself and my family, to be able to give back for all their sacrifices so far.
To be best version of myself


B. I will be on Week 2 of my journey here.
Goals:
1. Complete Week 2's checklist
2. Read at least 1/3 of Atomic Habits
3. Develop and implement a better schedule.

I'm not sure if I have any questions yet but will reach out if I do!
Thank you!

  - 2025-01-22 | Thank you for your input!!
  - 2025-01-22 | Though amz seller I do this? And then I can cancel it?
  - 2025-01-22 | Hello again, I know I keep asking the same question over and over again, I‚Äôm just very scared of losing a lot of money again. Given your experience is there any information on an estimate price for removal? For example starting from $2000. I know I need to decide and it‚Äôs in my own hands to decide which risk I‚Äôm willing to take, I fully understand that it‚Äôs just hard not to be scared because it‚Äôs a lot of units to waste money on. I hope you understand thank you again!! And I apologize for bringing up the same topic over and over!
  - 2025-01-14 | Of course it makes sense, and I know I can‚Äôt have it both ways I just want to see if it‚Äôs definitely not worth it not to go through with it. Obviously that is a decision I need to make but based on your experience you think removing is best case instead of dispose ? And I know we‚Äôve had this conversation before and I do need to take a risk but I am so scared to throw more money for nothing. At least I want to spend money on something that has more potential but of course everything comes witj risk
  - 2025-01-14 | Hi there, I have a question about removal order from amz. I asked Amazon and they do not provide information on pricing on removal order, would you know if it‚Äôs expensive, is it worth it? My thought process is to remove and send to a company so I can sell on Etsy. I am aware there is always risk but I also don‚Äôt want to waste so much more money.
  - 2024-12-17 | Hi there I‚Äôm having an issue with posting a listing, it is asking for a GTIN exemption application but it is asking for certain things that I do not have for example the brand name to be on the product! My product is electric. Do you happen to know what u could do, maybe just buy the code? I wanted to ask first if I could avoid it! Thank you all! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
  - 2024-12-11 | Thank you ur help is very appreciated!
  - 2024-12-11 | I will give it another try and we see how it goes!
  - 2024-12-11 | Yes and it makes it more difficult I get it, it‚Äôs just how are other sellers selling that‚Äôs why I want to try
  - 2024-12-11 | Yes definitely I will take a look at competitors also!!
  - 2024-12-11 | Yes makes sense, I wasn‚Äôt clear enough!
  - 2024-12-11 | Okay I will do under my brand, thank you so so much! I really appreciate the help because it‚Äôs very much needed!!
  - 2024-12-11 | Sorry to keep texting for small questions that I could have solved myself, it‚Äôs just because of everything going not so well I panic with every little thing!
  - 2024-12-11 | The inactive listing is still under the brand name omg I just realized I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm so stupid I had created another listing of another product  under the brand name and it was fine on seller central I just got scared!
  - 2024-12-11 | No I received an email that said the trademark is suspended but seller central hasn‚Äôt removed it
  - 2024-12-11 | So I discussed with Justin and there were a few ideas. 
1. I am in search for a facility to store my 600units so it‚Äôs cheaper than AMZ storage
2. I contacted a few people of fiver if they can help with reactivation of current listing, in the meantime I want to post a new listing to see if the issue is still there since I haven‚Äôt tried reactivation in a while. 
3. If reactivation does not work we will try to sell the products locally but will not bring back to Canada too much money. 
4. worst case scenario if nothing works we will dump the units and move on. 
5. We also contacted our supplier to see if they‚Äôd want them back no response yet!
6. My question is since my trademark was suspended (because very similar to another) I am unsure if I should post the new listing under the brand name we have or generic!
  - 2024-12-11 | Ok I will explain sorry if I was confusing
  - 2024-12-11 | I apologize for not replying earlier, so many things are going on at the moment!
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi there, thank you for reaching out! I had an issue with a product I had sent to amz warehouse but unfortunately my listing got rejected even though other sellers are still selling! I spoke with shifu Justin and he suggested to recreate a listing, at the moment my trademark is suspended. Should I create a new listing under generic or under my brand is fine also? Thank you so much!!

  - 2024-12-26 | Merry Christmas shifus ü§ç üéÑI hope everyone is having a wonderful time celebrating with family and loved ones. üéâ 

Btw, I have a question. There are quite a few customers who reached out to me in my social page if I ship internationally. Is there a way to set up MCF to ship internationally or linking to Shopify but using Amazon to fulfill those orders? Or what other methods can I expand my reach to international without moving inventory?
 
Thanks in advance üôè
  - 2024-12-21 | Ok. Thanks Han üôè
  - 2024-12-21 | Just hope they won‚Äôt do a random spot check on my products in the next 3 months or so üôè
  - 2024-12-21 | Ok. Thanks shifu. üôèüôè
  - 2024-12-21 | Since my insert card didn‚Äôt explicitly ask for any review, perhaps it is ok? So I just change the manychat to what I did before, only to give the warranty, now without asking for order ID too?
  - 2024-12-21 | I‚Äôm just afraid Amz will do spot check on my products. But it cost so much already just to withdraw and ship back so many units ü•π
  - 2024-12-21 | So I turn manychat off completely?
  - 2024-12-21 | So Im in a dilemma for my new stock that‚Äôs coming in‚Ä¶ because it has the same insert cards. I have 955 units inbound‚Ä¶ just received notification that the new stock has reached the fulfilment center today and it‚Äôs being processed now. 

So I shouldn‚Äôt risk selling those too, I should send all new 955 inbound stock back to my 3PL to get them to remove the insert cards too, right?
  - 2024-12-21 | They reinstated my listings and everything is fine now. I have withdrawn all my stock to 3PL. But I have new stock coming in that has the same insert cards.
  - 2024-12-21 | Located in NJ
  - 2024-12-21 | I withdrew them back to my 3PL
  - 2024-12-20 | Omg. Finally put out of my misery üò≠ 
Now the only problem is that the 3PL is super slow in responding. My listing will be closed for at least a month or two I think. I guess thats better than the account being deactivated. 

Also I have 955 units inbound. I probably need to ship all of them back to 3PL once those arrive Amz warehouse? I‚Äôm afraid they audit me and if they see the insert cards in there also, then there won‚Äôt be a second chance. But this is a super costly exercise, I‚Äôve already withdrawn back about 700+ units. 
What do you think I should do <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-12-20 | üôèüôè
  - 2024-12-19 | yeah makes no sense at all. anyway i put 3 in total. hope for the best
  - 2024-12-19 | I‚Äôll put 3 then. The recent ones oct-dec
  - 2024-12-19 | What if they contact the other reviewers
  - 2024-12-19 | So if I just submit that 1 should be fine right ü´£
  - 2024-12-19 | Other 10 said no
  - 2024-12-19 | I had 50 clicks. 40 of them left a review
  - 2024-12-19 | He asked me if there were other reviews on the site that were related to the violation. I said only this 1 but truthfully there were about 40+ reviews from insert card. Don‚Äôt know if I should disclose the full truth and if Amz can detect it?

The Fiverr guy said I should be honest with everything though. What do you think <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-12-19 | Here‚Äôs the draft of the appeal written by the Fiverr guy.
  - 2024-12-18 | Yes they‚Äôre writing it. 2 days delivery. So should be out by tomorrow
  - 2024-12-18 | Hi Han, so I spoke to two 5* rated Fiverr providers, and they both said the same thing. This was one of their reply. 

Greetings,

First of all, pardon me for my delayed response. Please note that my working hours align with US timings, as the majority of my clients are from the US. You will receive instant responses from me during my working hours. 

Anyway, after reviewing all the details you shared, I need you to know one thing, and this is the core of my years of experience in this niche, the way Amazon works, you need to accept the guilt. If you don't want to accept the guilt, you must provide a very high level of documentary proof that you are not guilty.

In your case, there is a violation, so I recommend acknowledging the mistake and proposing drastic measures to assure Amazon that you will no longer pose a risk of repeating the same mistake.

The Amazon team may already have that order ID in their records, and there is a possibility they will only accept the appeal if the violation is acknowledged. I think you need to send all the required details along with a very strong plan of action.
  - 2024-12-17 | He‚Äôs drafting the response now. I‚Äôll share it when he sends it to me
  - 2024-12-17 | This is incredibly stressful
  - 2024-12-17 | Also Amazon won‚Äôt give a second chance if this is violated again
  - 2024-12-17 | I engaged someone from Fiverr. He said the order ID is a must. And he insists that we need to be honest as amazon now knows everything üòì
He also told me to remove all my inventory including the other variation which has the insert card. He said the insert card is not allowed in Amazon policy, bc after receiving this violation 
Amazon will check all your products in FBA and they will find out that the other products contain cards too. And this type of insert card is violating the policies.
  - 2024-12-17 | this is some random person within a few days of that received review time frame...
  - 2024-12-17 | 6. List of Order IDs from Violated Customers
No customers were contacted in violation of Amazon policies, however this order was provided with a lifetime warranty.
Order ID: # 114-8626709-2321049
  - 2024-12-17 | ok, should i submit just 1 random order ID?
  - 2024-12-17 | The person who left that review actually didn‚Äôt leave his order ID in the flow too by error. But it was the full flow and I gave him a $10 gift card for it. I just found his name from the orders that came in within those few days and assume that‚Äôs his order. I wonder what the repercussions are jf if I were to give another random person‚Äôs order ID who didn‚Äôt actually leave any review.
  - 2024-12-17 | Anyway I submitted that new appeal and got rejected again. I‚Äôm now reaching out to Fiverr providers to ask further‚Ä¶probably I should use their help? I really hope this doesn‚Äôt end up closing my account .üò¢
  - 2024-12-17 | Yeah but on the call, the specialist did specify that even redirecting customers to fb messenger for order ID is considered a violation of the policy. Which relates to the question of:

A list of Order IDs of customers who were contacted in violation of our policy.

So technically the order ID of the customer who left a review, even if it wasn‚Äôt intended, should be disclosed. This is what I understood‚Ä¶
  - 2024-12-16 | If I remove it now from the flow it will be suspicious, since I already sent them the screenshots
  - 2024-12-16 | Here ü´£
  - 2024-12-16 | But in the previous screenshots of the messenger flow that I‚Äôve sent to them, it asks for the order IDüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
  - 2024-12-16 | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ads3unuWzwafoy41teIHypkF__VZ9aFOmAqa2OQIAbs/edit?tab=t.0

<@536075832658231299> can you please check this if the details are sufficient and if it needs any editing? I hope to send it out asap. I sincerely appreciate your help. Thank you so much ü´∂ üôè
  - 2024-12-16 | im also afraid if i disclose the Order ID, Amazon might reach out to the customer and ask them if the review was incentivised.
  - 2024-12-16 | btw, my account got deactivated today. it's super nervewrecking as I have funds locked as well as 1000+ units there. üò≠
  - 2024-12-16 | one of the questions asked was this:
6. A list of all Order IDs from customers who were contacted in violation of our Customer product review policies.

can i disclose the order ID of this person? because yesterday on the phone with the specialist, he kept saying the missing part from internal team was that i needed to give them the order ID. if i didn't incentivise review, just mention the order ID and that the QR code was included in the product packaging sent to him.

or do i reply:
no customers were contacted in violation of Amazon policies.

But it doesn't make sense since if i reply no customers were contacted in violation, since i'm saying that i understand now that redirecting customers to FB messenger even if its for lifetime warranty is a violation... so technically all customers who have scanned the QR and registered their Order ID is counted as a violation, isn't it?
  - 2024-12-15 | Ok let me work on it again‚Ä¶ thanks so much Han üôè
  - 2024-12-15 | Possible Root Cause of Violation:
The language used in the product insert card may have caused misunderstanding, as well as I was not aware that redirecting customers using Facebook messenger to register lifetime warranty was not allowed.
  - 2024-12-15 | None of our products have been associated with incentives for positive reviews or any form of review manipulation. We only offered a lifetime warranty for ASIN: B0CRDLWZRY, without asking for any type of review (please see previous screenshots of QR End-to-end experience).
  - 2024-12-15 | - https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=G8CXDFT9GLRRSV3G
- And all other relevant policies.

Addition to that, as per your questions in the submission please see the following:

1. Methods Used to Obtain Customer Information:
We did not use any methods to collect customers‚Äô personal information for incentivizing or manipulating reviews. The QR code on our product insert is solely for directing customers to register for a manufacturer‚Äôs lifetime warranty. It does not collect information for review purposes.
    
2. Start Date for Product Review Abuse:
There has been no product review abuse from our side. We have never incentivized or asked customers for reviews.
    
3. Third-Party Contact Information:
No third-party services, companies, or external groups were used to obtain customer personal information or solicit reviews.
    
4. Documentation from Third Parties:
Since no third parties were involved, there are no documents, emails, or receipts related to such services.
    
5. Documents, QR Code End-to-End Experience:
I have attached screenshots in my previous appeal showing the full experience of the QR code flow. It directs customers to register for their lifetime warranty, without mentioning reviews or asking for them. We also never obtained any personal information from customers, other than their Order ID, just so we can take note of customers' future warranty claims.
    
6. List of Order IDs and Reviews Obtained Prohibitedly:
There are no Order IDs or reviews that were obtained through prohibited methods, as we have never engaged in such activities.
  
7. List of all products where you have asked for positive reviews or offered any incentives, such as discounts, free products, or other benefits, to customers in exchange for them writing product reviews.
  - 2024-12-15 | Hi Amazon Team, 

It was really nice speaking with you on the phone. Thank you so much for clarifying my queries before I send out another appeal. As requested and understood, here are the responses to your queries:

Corrective Actions and Prevention Plan

Possible Root Cause of Violation:
The language used in the product insert card may have caused misunderstanding.

Action Plan:
1. Withdraw and Inspect Units - Retrieve units and inspect them to remove existing insert cards that has any misleading language. (Removal order ID: 241211122C)

2. Redesign Insert Card - Create a new insert card by this coming week that avoids any misleading language that might encourage customers to leave a review, and to focus strictly solely on highlighting the lifetime warranty offered to them without any other misleading language.

3. Restricted Communications: All our team members have been informed that all customer communication will occur only through Amazon‚Äôs messaging tools, even when they request for an exchange of a faulty product to claim the warranty is to be communicated via Amazon channel only.

4. Regular Training: Our team will undergo detailed training bi-weekly starting Monday 16th December 2024 on Amazon‚Äôs policies to avoid future violations. We will also conduct a monthly seminar to train our team on any updated or new policies implemented by Amazon. Below are some of the many links to the policies and content related to this matter we will be training our staff with, starting this coming Monday the 16th of December.

  - 2024-12-15 | this was my latest appeal, and it got rejected again. i don't know what should i write next to them?
  - 2024-12-15 | but the QR code directs to FB messenger, the specialist said its considered 3rd party
  - 2024-12-15 | this reply...
  - 2024-12-15 | what do you think if i include this screenshot of the review and the order ID by him, as well as the screenshot of my reply to him, that a review wasn't required in exchange for a warranty?
then mention that i wasn't aware that redirecting customers to FB messenger was not allowed, and will stop doing this moving forward?
  - 2024-12-15 | i have a feeling that it was because of this review and i need to prove it somehow...
  - 2024-12-15 | hi shifu han, i submitted new appeal but was replied the same exact thing again. i just spoke to account health specialist again, and he said the internal team discovered there was the violation. they asked to provide:
- details of the 3rd party co, or app used to request review
- review ID & order ID that was requested.

I kept saying no i did not ask for reviews. he said its one of the thing that was detected internally. if i really didnt request, QR redirects to FB messenger which is also not allowed. so i can mention that I wasnt aware of that but from the call with him, i feel like thats not good enough to lift the violation...

1. Added online manual and troubleshooting in Manychat. I‚Äôm working on to optimize that flow

  - 2025-02-06 | Ok  I got it
  - 2025-02-06 | Hi @han and @susan, could you help taking a look at the PPC Tracker and the Data Visibility? I updated the data
PPC - Tracker https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nkZ7lJ0kwd6v9Uk-NOSwFZjar0OD0HPh0ZnaQA7y3EE/edit?usp=sharing
Data Visibility - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZFIwMQemqTUwzJtENIPzGKQ55RTxa6mZjwGh-dhj8-w/edit?usp=sharing
The sales is picking up so I expected the stock to run out before the end of the month. 
1st Optimization had avg ACOS of 61%
2nd Optimization has avg ACOS of 47%
Should I target the ACOS for 30% this time?
  - 2025-01-24 | I got it. Thanks @Han
  - 2025-01-23 | 1. Given my situation of expected 2nd batch on May and expected OOS date on late Feb /early March, should I add PROVEN and TEST campaign? 
2. If yes, at what budget should I set for PROVEN and TEST campaign?
3. From my understanding, managing bleeder is weekly and BID Optimization is biweekly, is that correct?

  - 2025-02-04 | My domain includes <brandname>usa.com
You can try this way em
  - 2025-01-30 | That could be a situation Trish. Also I think after we receive the product 2-3 days, the acct will become verify purchase, cuz Amz wants customers to spend some times using products.
  - 2025-01-30 | Probably, now I‚Äôm re-flow the Manychat to ask customers to leave reviews 2-3 days after receive the product, also setup automatic reminder.
  - 2025-01-30 | Got it thank you shifu
  - 2025-01-30 | What‚Äôs the best way to optimize Manychat review scanning?
- I have 2 customers scanned the code and want to leave reviews, but the problem is they got the item for not too long, and Amz did not let them review right away. 
What‚Äôs the best way to ask customers to leave it in a few more days AT THE BEGINING? Or we just send messages to remind them? Thank you guys!!!

  - 2025-02-19 | Hi em, for your product link to Instagram page, just create an Attribution tag from Amazon (someone did mention how to do that in the group, you may search: Attribution tag for it)
- then you can convert that long link into bitly.com or similar platform to shorter the link
- Use that link to put on your page bio
- That way when someone click on your link and purchase, you'll get 10% commission back

  - 2025-02-11 | Hi, I'm Georgy

I currently live in New Jersey with my wife, and we‚Äôre expecting our first child this summer. My journey has taken me through big life changes, including relocating for medical reasons and leaving my previous job. Now, I‚Äôm focused on building a new path‚Äîone that gives me financial freedom and allows me to provide the best life for my family.

I joined this program to replace the traditional 9-to-5, aiming to generate at least $10,000 per month within the next 3 to 5 months. More than just financial goals, I want to create a lifestyle filled with meaningful experiences, stability, and opportunities.

My Vision for the Next 5 Years:
In five years, I see myself financially independent, running a successful business that provides consistent income without being tied to a job. My family will be at peace, enjoying a comfortably, traveling and experiencing the best life has to offer. I want to give my child a bright future with the freedom to explore their passions.

Most importantly, I want to live life on my own terms: having time for my family, personal growth, and creating lasting memories while continuing to build wealth.

I believe success comes from consistency and determination, and I'm excited for this journey. Let‚Äôs make it happen!

  - 2024-12-11 | officially out of stock!
  - 2024-12-11 | thank you guys!
  - 2024-12-11 | you got it. I closed both üòä
  - 2024-12-11 | if my supply has 1 fc transfer left in stock. does that count as fba cause my fba listing doesn‚Äôt even show anymore
  - 2024-12-11 | Ok I will close both listings then haha
  - 2024-12-11 | since I have only 1 left in stock in fc transfer and my listing is now showing my fbm. should I close both listings now?
  - 2024-12-11 | thank you Jamie! ü•∞
  - 2024-12-10 | thank you so much han for your help as well as everyone üòä
  - 2024-12-02 | thank you susan!
  - 2024-12-02 | so it's in the process of being transferred to another warehouse I believe
  - 2024-12-02 | oh ok so on hand is available + FC transfer
  - 2024-12-02 | ?
  - 2024-12-02 | does that mean I actually have 62 units still available
  - 2024-12-02 | which i am a bit confused about
  - 2024-12-02 | 
  - 2024-12-02 | hi guys, so i sold out for black friday. I am in the process of ordering my next batch. what is the difference between on hand and available? On hand it says I have 62 units left, but available is 0. Though Amazon has not marked it as out of stock.
  - 2024-11-26 | thanks Han
  - 2024-11-26 | Hi guys! So I have a quick question. I have my funds from my sales but I have a negative balance. It‚Äôs from charges from my ads, should I turn off my ads for now and turn it on when my funds load?
  - 2024-11-22 | It was there like 10 minutes ago
  - 2024-11-22 | I just fixed it
  - 2024-11-22 | I think it got suppressed again
  - 2024-11-22 | thank you Louis!
  - 2024-11-22 | 
  - 2024-11-22 | it keeps getting suppressed & says that I need to change my minimum price

  - 2024-11-22 | Hi guys! Can you guys take a look at my listing real quick and see if my Black Friday deal is on? My sales are super slow üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
  - 2024-11-14 | I can‚Äôt access the link ü•π
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you Jamie!
  - 2024-11-12 | No worries it wasn‚Äôt your fault! I think it was Amazon removing ‚Äúviolated‚Äù posts ü•π
  - 2024-11-12 | I have no clue why it was removed ü•≤
  - 2024-11-12 | It was Louis and Khoa
  - 2024-11-09 | was there any violations in these reviews?
  - 2024-11-09 | with videos
  - 2024-11-09 | 2. Tagline: Great product great price. = I went camping with one of my friends and they had one similar to this one. After receiving this product, I can tell that it is much higher quality and I love it so much already. I tried all the features and function and it was great. Definitely 10/10!!!
  - 2024-11-09 | 1. Tagline: Perfect for Security and Peace of Mind = Working the graveyard shift as a security guard, I bought these to use at night. I've tried other brands, but Virtual Haven's goggles are by far the best. The images are sharp, and the IR illuminator works flawlessly even in complete darkness. These goggles are well-built and rugged, which is a huge plus since I often work in harsh weather conditions. The battery life is excellent, lasting through my entire shift.
  - 2024-11-09 | Can you guys help me review my reviews and why were they taken down?
  - 2024-11-09 | thanks han!
  - 2024-11-07 | please let me know if I'm doing them correctly
  - 2024-11-07 | I turned in the inventory management hw and data visibility hw!
  - 2024-11-07 | Yes I actually do need some help with PPC. I reached out to Louis for help but if I can get help from you that would be great too!
  - 2024-11-03 | is the price im selling right now, I would put in the minimum price box?
  - 2024-11-03 | thank you susan

  - 2024-10-25 | all good thank u
  - 2024-10-25 | i tried just the 725-210-7249 but it wont let me either
  - 2024-10-25 | Hi <@536075832658231299> it wont let me schedule a meeting wd u. the phone number Im trying to key in says invalid but this is the number Im using. 

Phone no: 725-210-7249.
  - 2024-10-16 | I'm just really afraid that if we change anything in the listing may mess up what we currently have and will have to go through the review process again... but pls let me know if u think otherwise. thank u
  - 2024-10-16 | Is the deep link mandatory? since we're not hiring freelancers to do the reviews. But instead, we'll have maybe 2 or 3 of our staff make the purchase and then reimbursed and will do the reviews
  - 2024-10-16 | 
  - 2024-10-16 | my concern is that if I do that, I'm afraid it'll mess up the previous data we have for the listing and may lead to another listing review.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hello <@1066465177140215928> I tried changing the product title but it won't give me the option to just change the title b/c it prompts us to update the whole listing.
  - 2024-10-16 | Thanks Han. I was trying to create a deeplink using this link which incl our ASIN but not getting any results  -- https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thermal+label+printer&hidden-keywords=[B0D937HW3R]&ref=nb_sb_noss_1
  - 2024-10-15 | Good morning @everyonecould I get your thoughts on the above please? Thank u
  - 2024-10-14 | My IP address is already registered with our Seller Central account. Im just afraid that it will create an issue or red flag if I create a deeplink using the same device, considering that I am located in the Philippines and not in the US?
  - 2024-10-14 | Q2: re: the creation of deeplink. 

the instructions said that it was meant for a freelancer through Upwork... Is it okay to create deeplink acct using the same device, IP address and email we use for our Seller acct,
  - 2024-10-14 | and so I was wondering if its possible or better if I just copy the listing and then add another condition then set up fbm
  - 2024-10-14 | Hello @everyone, could I pls get ur thoughts on this-- I notice that whenever we click on add another condition and set up an fbm... the listing changes from fba to fbm

  - 2024-03-05 | Hi everyone. When filing for a trademark, would you suggest paying for their service to search USPTO records? I did a high level search and it looks like there are no conflicts. However, just wanted to ensure it doesn't get denied and cause further delay.
  - 2025-02-10 | You're in luck, S23 supports esim and has dual sim, meaning it has 2 slots for physical sim card. So you can go VN and buy a sim card. Just make sure your phone is unlocked
  - 2025-02-10 | Not sure which phone you have but, if if your phone supports esim and physical sim, you can get a sim card in Vietnam and just use your UD number via esim. Thatll be the easiest.
  - 2024-12-11 | Hi. I would close the FBM unless you have inventory at home you're looking to sell.
  - 2024-11-22 | that should be fine, i usually set it a dollar or so lower to avoid it from getting supressed.. once schedule.. you'll see the Discounted Prime Price
  - 2024-11-12 | Jennifer,that's odd. I checked my other reviews and it's up. I can try to submit again.
  - 2024-12-09 | Hi Trish, it might not be showing up because you are out of stock. Quick way to verify is to add inventory in your FBM.
  - 2024-12-27 | Congrats <@1244808317033906277> ! Take some time and prioritize the baby and yourself!
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Hannah, during my sourcing phase, I had suppliers willing to do it without any cost as long as we handled the logistics and ship the add-on items to them. As Jamie mentioned, it'll depend on your negotiation and how accommodating your supplier is.
  - 2024-12-18 | Tom - Are you talking about the Mastermind Event?
  - 2024-12-18 | Sounds good. Thanks
  - 2024-12-12 | Got it. I added the T&C over to my copy.
  - 2024-12-12 | <@454372168852045844> - Sure. I requested access to the doc below and will update my version.
  - 2024-12-09 | I agree. My suggestion to him was a result of me assuming he has some knowledge of PPC. Now looking back at it, he might be very limited. He probably isn't aware of your PPC Assistance.  During the meeting, you'll probably get a good sense of where he is at.
  - 2024-12-09 | yea i met with him super late at night one time ...i tried to accommodate
  - 2024-12-09 | He asked me if he should increase budget to get more sales.. i instructed him to optimize his PPC and cut out all the wasted ad spend..and naturally the spend will go into the kw that are working...
  - 2024-12-09 | He def is asking all the questions he should've asked prior to launching
  - 2024-12-09 | =X
  - 2024-12-09 | He is asking me to meet with me weekly.. i suggested he connect with you Susan/Han first... sorry
  - 2024-12-09 | https://a.co/d/8FBCO72
  - 2024-12-09 | haha but what do i know?
  - 2024-12-09 | I also notice he updated his listing main listing image as well..and it doesnt look eye catching tbh
  - 2024-12-09 | It's def going to be an uphill battle for him. His margin is razor thin at the price he is selling at.  His PPC, i dont think he optimized... so i told him, one way to lower ad spend is optimize and work on removing the bleeders....as susan mentioned, challenge is that he wants quick results and that isn't something that is reallistic
  - 2024-12-09 | I agree with you Tim. I had a meeting with him 2 weeks ago. I also know he didn't manage his PPC since he launched. I think he mentioned he didn't have much time and just recently started to focus on it
  - 2024-12-09 | He also said he let his PPC " go a little crazy to gain sales".....so looks like he went off the path to chase sales which is costing him.
  - 2024-12-09 | thats not counting PPC
  - 2024-12-09 | He is operating at a 7-8% margin
  - 2024-12-09 | Same. He just reached out to me as well.
  - 2024-12-09 | Morning All. Jenny Dean messaged me to ask about launching. She currently has 39 units available and 161 reserved, she was looking to launch.  I instructed her to connect with Susan/Han prior to launch to review her PPC. She thought she has to pay for the meeting/review.  I also instructed her to not launch until she has at least 100 units available.  

<@1066465177140215928> - I instructed her to connect with you first before a meeting with han.

I didn't see a private channel in discord, so just wanted to give everyone a heads up here.
  - 2024-12-09 | Hi Tom. 

Please see link below regarding the SOP for Ambassadors.  Please review and let me know if you need to add/remove/update anything.

Thanks
  - 2024-12-07 | Signed.
  - 2024-12-07 | Got it! She messaged me saying you both connected!
  - 2024-11-21 | No need to ask Kathy. It's been taking longer I noticed around this time. I have had units that got checked in about 3 weeks ago.. and im still waiting for it to become available.
  - 2025-01-10 | #duma fine I'll eat it

  - 2025-01-10 | BBH han, no blood cubes please
  - 2025-01-10 | I'm gonna log into my seller account and you optimize it
  - 2025-01-10 | <@1168356026471436323> already volunteered for a food tour tomorrow
  - 2025-01-10 | Haha
  - 2025-01-10 | Damn...I'm already at the airport, who's house am I having dinner at?
  - 2025-01-10 | Road trip! If you leave now, you'll make it 19 hours.

  - 2025-01-29 | Just got my brand approved, feels like a BIG win for me since everything in Sweden works a bit different with all the paperworks, and also my account at the seller central is also Swedish. So it makes me so happy that it worked out.  Thanks Minh and Susan for helping me with some tips and support ü•∞ ...
  - 2025-02-17 | Love it! üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è

  - 2025-02-20 | Hi! Im fine, thanks üôÇ Hope u guys are doing fine aswell. Right now Im waiting for the production of my bulk order. Susan is helping me oiut with all that comes with A+ content and the listing. Feeling a bit impatient and stressed about the production time, they are so slow... But its also important for me to learn to be more patient.
  - 2025-02-09 | So I got the answer from the brand registry support today that It was because my application said that my brand is "pending" in Sweden, which it still is. But I needed to confirm that with a document. So now the problem is solved üôÇ
  - 2025-02-08 | no üò¶ But I got an answer from the support saying that they are reviewing my case, so I guess Ill have an answer very soon.
  - 2025-02-06 | yes, should I delete the old one then?
  - 2025-02-05 | Also, the seller support couldnt give me a clear answer on this ü´§
  - 2025-02-05 | I selected it from the drop down. üôÇ
  - 2025-02-05 | 
  - 2025-02-05 | But when I look at my listing, nothing of this seems to be wrong?
  - 2025-02-05 | Also contacted the support att amazon who responded with this:

    

Hello from Amazon Brand Registry Support,

Thank you for contacting us, This is Madhumitha

We understand your issue is regarding ASIN not recognized as part of my brand

Please be informed that, when the ASIN is not properly being mapped to your brand you receive this error
This is usually caused by inaccurate listing data on the ASIN, which you can fix by editing. The most common data points that need updating are:

Brand name mismatch: The brand name listed on the ASIN does not match the brand name as approved by Amazon's Brand Registry. These need to match 100%. Adding spaces or hyphens will lead to a mismatch.
Note: Brand name is case sensitive.
Inaccurate GTIN or Key Attribute. Your ASIN listing data must include a GTIN (UPC, EAN, JAN) that is correct and consistent with your brand. The most common GTIN/Key Attributes are:
UPC
Part number
Model number
Style number
Catalog number
Categorization: The item type category which closely matches with the ASIN product type should be selected in the listing details.

  - 2025-02-05 | Hi! Hope u are doing well üôÇ Got stuck with this issue when applying for A+ content...
  - 2025-01-14 | Thank you Minh! For also pushing me to try harder every day, because of that I didn‚Äôt give up on this product. I‚Äôve already received the samples and approved them. So my next step is paying the deposit of the bulk order üôÇ . I will do that today because after production of my first order it‚Äôll take 35 days for the product to be shipped. So I want to move as quick as I can to get the product to market.
  - 2025-01-13 | Here it is... üôÇ Not 100% sure about the fba fee since I dont know which fba center its going to be, so I just looked at all the other sellers on Amazon and I calculated on a "higher fee" because I believe thats better than doing the opposite and get disappointed if the fee is higher than expected.
  - 2025-01-13 | Hi! So sorry for the inconveniences, but after a couple of weeks with a lot of research and negotiating I finnaly made it with a new supplier that I found. So Ill skip the baby-product. It wasnt a good market and also it requierd a lot of test results and documentation. So Im now back at the "nut milk maker" and my profit with my new deal will be at least 30%. So, I guess Ill just pull the trigger now and place the first bulk order of 500 pcs. Scary... but exciting. is there something that you want to advise me on before I do it? üôÇ
  - 2025-01-05 | Thank you Minh! Ill work on finding a very good offer with my supplier. Also, if I cant get a margin of more than 30% maybe Ill try go back to the nut milk maker once again,  and find a way to package the product so it can go under "large-standard". It will be hard, but its always worth a last try... üôÇ
  - 2025-01-03 | I will also apply to get the right certification for this product, it will be 400USD but its ok, as long as you still think that I can go with this product üôÇ
  - 2025-01-03 | Hi! Since my 1-1 with Minh Ive been working to find a solution for lower the shipping cost for my product, but unfortunately it will still be "large and bulky" so I guess I need to drop that product and move on with another because I will not have enough margin. So my next choice is the "Baby Nest Lounger", a much smaller market. The sellers are not making the same amounts as within the market of the "nut milk maker" but the numbers are still ok. Just need to make sure that this product is one of  your "blacklisted" one that you dont recommend?
  - 2024-12-27 | Merry Christmas to all of you üôÇ ‚ù§Ô∏è hope you have a wonderful christmas weekend.

I have a question that I need some guidance with. My product is a "nut milk maker" as you might now already. It comes in 800 ml or 1000 ml, and the 1000 ml is the "new model". The price is the same for both of them but the listing price at Amazon is higher for the bigger one ofc. So I decided to go with the 1000 ml until I read the measurements of the box. It will be a large-bulky product if I go with the bigger one, the box is 21x21x43 cm and its also more heavy. 
What would you recommend me to do? Still go with the bigger one? Or change it to the smaller 800 ml?
  - 2024-12-21 | So, I tried the other method yesterday üôÇ But it didnt work out. Because I dont have any pictures of my product or the packages yet with my logo. The supplier didnt send me a sample with the logo, just a generic one to test. So when I do the bulk order of 500 pcs, that will be the first time the product and the box comes with my brand. And they will all be shipped direct to the FBA. Do you now any other tips to work this out? Or do I need to get a brand approval, is that the only choice left? üôÇ
  - 2024-12-17 | Thanks Minh!  üôÇ Yes, I watched that tutorial and at first I thought about skipping the "brand registry process" for now but then I just talked to so many mentees that recommended me to do it anyway.... So I got a bit confused in my decision.
However, I should start with ordering my first batch (500 pcs) then I guess. And meanwhile I should continue working with learning how to use  manychat. I think Ill let the supplier ship directly to the FBA-center if you dont recommend me to do otherwise.
  - 2024-12-17 | Just to make sure I dont do any mistakes...can you plese help me be more clear in what step to take in which order from now. Very confused ny now, feels a bit overwhelming with all these new info and so many things to be aware of. 

I¬¥ve chosen my supplier and they will start produce my first batch.

What do I need to prepare now? How do I move on?
- do I need the brand registration to be done?
- do I need to be done with all the "fb-page" and "manychat" things also?
- When do I move on to module 3?

feels like im in some kind of gray area right now, having a hard time choosing my next action. But would love to make a clear action plan.
  - 2024-12-16 | Ok! Thanks üôÇ Is it easier to be successful with this product if I put my logo on it ?
  - 2024-12-16 | Hi! Ive been having a hard time negotiating with the suppliers. None of them will accept 200 pcs for customizing. 500 pcs are the minimum. Also spoke to Macy who comfirmed that she cant find one that will do it for under 500 pcs. What would you recommend me to do?
  - 2024-12-09 | Perf, thanks <@536075832658231299> ! I will get in touch with GS1 tomorrow... üôÇ
  - 2024-12-09 | 
  - 2024-12-09 | 
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Jamie! Im fine thanks, hope u are too... Still waiting for my first samples to arrive, excited about that. My biggest challenge right now is to get my supplier to apply all my requested changes on the product. Find the right packaging, and I find it hard to know exactly what to do and to do things in the right order. But ill get there...
  - 2024-11-15 | Do you think its ok even tho its in the baby-category?  if yes, ill start contacting suppliers and work on my profit-calculation. If you dont recommend to go with that product because of the "catagory" I have another ont that might be a potential product.
  - 2024-11-15 | The product that was "ok" is this one https://www.amazon.com/s?k=baby%20lounger%20nest%20portable&ref=glow_cls&refresh=1
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you <@1054411267340763216> for being so helpful and for all your patience
  - 2024-11-11 | Ok, thank you <@1054411267340763216>  ! That was my guess too, but I find the product super interesting since it‚Äôs the NO 1 baby product in Scandinavia. It‚Äôs a genius product. Too bad it‚Äôs not that big in the US yet. Thanks for your good advice as always üôèü´∂
  - 2024-11-11 | Here it is üôÇ
  - 2024-11-10 | H i again!Sorry for bothering with all these question... But the reason I dont want to ask this one officially is because its about a very spceial product that I would like to keep secret until I know how to deal with it. Hope its ok. 
In Sweden there is a product called "vibrating stroller rocket". Its universal for all baby strollers and puts the baby to sleep. Its a VERY popular product in Sweden. So I did some PR on Amazon and I noticed that this product isnt really big yet in the US. There is a couple of sellers making ok profit.  Is this a "dangerous" product to work with or how come the number of sellers are so few? Also a product I should stay away from? Or do you think I can go deeper with the anlysis? 

Heres the product https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHFDJ6P9?psc=1
  - 2024-11-09 | Ok, got it! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks Han! ‚≠êÔ∏èüôè
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi guys! Hope u are fine ‚ò∫Ô∏è just a quick question about my PR since I needed to cancel my product ‚Äúcordless table lamp rechargeable‚Äù. Is it just that kind of model that is on your black list? Or is it lightning over all? Would you recommend me to stay away from all kind of lamps?
  - 2024-10-28 | 
  - 2024-10-28 | Ah, I just saw that the class tomorrow is at 2 am in the morning for me. üòï  So I will not be able to attend. But I can attend the class at Friday if there is any?
  - 2024-10-28 | If i want to to bring a product up in the meeting for analyse, do I need to send any form to you before the class? üôÇ
  - 2024-10-26 | Perfect, thank you so much for that! What do I need to prepare for that class? üôÇ
  - 2024-10-26 | For me, the schedule looks like this with my timezone.
  - 2024-10-26 | So, Ive been trying to analyse around 15-20 products now. But since the class with you <@1054411267340763216> at wednesdays are at 3 am in the morning for me, I havent been able to join and bring them up for feedback in the class. Can i bring it up at another class? The one on thursdays, mondays or saturdays? These ones are more easy for me to attend because of the timezone... Or will that be the wrong forum for this?
  - 2024-10-21 | Thanks <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out... Really appreciate! Been feeling kind of lonely the past week. Its so hard to keep up with the classes since im in a different time zone. Even tho I watch the recordings I feel like Im behind since I dint get the same chance to participate live and ask questions... But I do my best! üôÇ 

Last week I leared how to use the PR-tracking sheet and I tried a lot of different tools in Helium10. Not sure how good my draft is but there is 7 products in my tracking sheet right now that Ive been practicing to analyze.  I try to find one product for each day. to analyze and find an opportunity with.
  - 2024-11-01 | Yes, we have matched up. Me and <@772970575144288288>  üôÇ
  - 2024-10-22 | Perfect! <@772970575144288288>
  - 2024-10-21 | My location is Sweden and my timezone is  GMT+2, my strengths is my energy and 
willingness to learn. Im a "protoganist" in the personality test üôÇ
  - 2025-02-13 | ah, SORRY! üôÇ Because of the time zone your message that said "tomorrow" was sent to me today... haha.
  - 2025-02-13 | The ics file still says today... Is there a new ics? üôÇ

  - 2024-11-18 | Team - update on Long as I would like to close the loop, due to personal matters he will be unable to rejoin the program, I will continue to stay in touch and check in on him and his family every so often but do take a moment to pray for him and his family as they are going through some difficult times. I have updated his account accordingly and left a note there as well.

All - I would like to provide an update regarding <@1263229562142330913>who is currently under financial distress due to unexpected personal circumstances. I met with him tonight to discuss the status of his membership and we've decided to put him on pause as he wish to remain in the program. I have a follow-up meeting to check-in with him regarding his situation and reassess his status a month from now on Wed 11/6. I've informed him to reach out to us through this dedicated private channel if his situation improves and we can resume active support for him.

<@1263229562142330913> We will be praying for you brother and please do not hesitate to reach out to our team through this chat if you need anything. Please keep us updated, will check up on you and your family in a month.

  - 2025-01-28 | I think it will cause the product pool to shrink, it's already challenging enough to find a viable product to begin with base on current conditions, CPC will naturally be aligned to it's respective market, base on price and demand...a high CPC can indicate high demand, high competition but doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, just a different set of challenges in the market and if one can stand out in this particular market, the product can thrive but on the flip side, it can net lower margins, limit differentiation, etc...same thing can go wiith lower CPC...it could possibly indicate lower demand, low competition, low buyer intent, etc. but a product can thrive in this market as well....either case, when done right, can potentially net positive outcomes so I personally think limiting to just low CPC limits opportunities...just my 2 cents
  - 2024-12-18 | Yes
  - 2024-12-18 | All - the upcoming event will have a registration fee to confirm attendance, I just want to inform this team that you are exempt from the fee which includes <@308107877493768193> <@297667891992723457> <@308107877493768193> , an announcement will be coming soon

  - 2024-12-09 | <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444> We need to create a private channel for Jenny ASAP, she joined back in April and we need to re-align expectations with her, I would recommend getting on a call, are we not actively working with her prior to transitioning to launching?

  - 2024-10-26 | @everyone I just met with Jose, he's committed but going through some challenges with a demanding work schedule (10-14 hours a day, multiple facilities), his schedule should stabilize within a month, so in the meantime we agree to the following so that he can continue to make some progress (1% a day) to maintain some momentum:

1) <@1054411267340763216> will follow-up with Jose to check-in with him once a week to make sure he is maintaining some degree of progress - no need to keep following up regarding homework and assignments until Jose schedule stabilizes

3) <@1218639416277467216> will not be able to attend classes due to his schedule being unpredictable, but he will leverage this dedicated private channel for questions as he reviews the content

<@1054411267340763216> Please give Jose some breathing room, he is committed to taking small actions every week to move forward, when he becomes more stable with his job's schedule, we'll ramp up and help him catch up

  - 2024-12-20 | Team - I was able to meet with Huy today and we had a great conversation covering his goals and priorities as well as the reason to put things on hold with building an Amazon business.

We will check back in with Huy a year from now but will stay connected as I would like to include him on any future networking events. Huy will be focusing on one main thing which is real estate during this time.

  - 2025-02-15 | I did but I'm still confused. Sorry. <@1054411267340763216> Like do I ask for quotes for 5 locations and then add up a few to see how much it costs total vs the 1 location shipping fee on amazon??
  - 2025-01-29 | I'm really stumped by this shipping to 1-5 warehouses and calculating which option is cheapest thing. It wouldn't make sense for our first batch right? Because its only like 200-300 units. What was your strategy? Is there a good contact to help with this?
  - 2025-01-29 | How many units was this?
  - 2025-01-26 | Is this normal that we have to keep paying after registration to keep our brand registration in use? Do you guys know a cheaper resource to help?

  - 2025-01-23 | Thank you Justin!
  - 2025-01-23 | Are you able to send it through your stock from Amazon or you need to keep some in your home?

  - 2025-02-20 | Phuong has it right. Just submit your invoice from your supplier and let them know the total cost for each unit. They will reimburse you for the lost units. If they eventually locate the lost units, they will just charge back for the reimbursement.
  - 2025-02-14 | My forwarder gave me the option of regular sea, Matson, or air. I chose Matson cause it was faster than regular and only a little more expensive. Also, my forwarder said when shipping to the West warehouses, transferring to truck when it hits the port is faster than UPS and is cheaper. UPS is best for east coast according to him. So I go with Matson + truck shipping.
  - 2025-02-12 | I‚Äôve only shipped by Matson, which is considered a faster sea shipping. So I have nothing else to compare to sea-wise.
  - 2025-02-12 | I‚Äôm glad Eleni answered your questions. Just wanted to add that if you don‚Äôt like the warehouse locations they‚Äôre being sent to, you can redo the form and sometimes they will shuffle around the arrangements to different warehouses.

I had to do this a few times cause my forwarder said one that was chosen was a newer warehouse, which he recommended to avoid.
  - 2025-02-11 | But I hope your experience is different!
  - 2025-02-11 | I also want to add something to consider.  Based on my experience with air shipping, I‚Äôd only do it if you currently have inventory and are trying to not sell out. 

If you‚Äôre already sold out then the price difference isn‚Äôt really worth the  extra week or so of getting your inventory.

My air shipping was estimated for 15-20 days and sea was 30-40 days. My air shipping arrived after 20 days and my sea arrived after 35 days. After Amazon processing, air shipping only beat sea by ~7 days. It wasn‚Äôt worth the extra $1000 for me üòî
  - 2025-02-11 | Haha I‚Äôm glad I clarified! You‚Äôre very welcome.
  - 2025-02-11 | When you send those to your supplier just make a note to them that there are two separate arrangements. They should already know what to do though once you tell them your plan.
  - 2025-02-11 | Yeah so you‚Äôll have two FBA labels. One for fast and one for sea.

You‚Äôll fill out the ‚Äúsend to Amazon‚Äù form twice. One with the fast shipping details and one with the regular sea shipping details.
  - 2025-02-11 | I always go with West cause it‚Äôs cheaper and faster.
  - 2025-02-11 | Yeah you‚Äôll just set it according to the estimate from your supplier/forwarder. 

Just to be clear, you‚Äôll have two separate FBA shipment ID‚Äôs. You won‚Äôt be splitting the 5 warehouse shipments into some shipping by air and some by sea.
  - 2025-02-11 | Your regular labels and fast shipping labels will just have different information on it but there shouldn‚Äôt be any difference in the process. 

You‚Äôll just provide them the labels and they should arrange it accordingly.

  - 2024-12-12 | 1. Things won‚Äôt always go as planned, so be willing to adapt to create a new plan.
2. Uncomfortable tasks are unavoidable when reaching for success. So take those on with a positive attitude.
3. Acting smart can only take you so far in life. Be honest when you lack the knowledge and be open to learning.

  - 2024-04-24 | Hi Lowell, I used a UPS private mailbox address as my business address. Whichever address you decide to use, customers will see it.
  - 2025-01-30 | Hi Kazoua, this is the sheet we used in the past for initial set up and optimizations. Hope this helps. 

There may be an updated version somewhere.
  - 2024-12-04 | This is a response from my lawyers when I wanted to remove assigned search codes:

‚ÄúThere is a mechanism to delete design search codes. However, the deletion is a separate submission and a brief justification as to the request must be made under Trademark Office rules. The design search codes were selected by the Trademark Office. As reflected in the Official USPTO Notice of Design Search Code, ‚Äúassigning design search codes to your mark helps us [the USPTO] more effectively search our database for marks that may conflict with yours. Design search codes have no legal significance and will not appear on the registration certificate.‚Äù (Emphasis added.)
 
Given that the likelihood-of-confusion 2(d) search has already been conducted, the design search codes are now moot. However, if you would nonetheless like us to attempt to have them removed from the record, our quote would be $300. We ask that you provide us with the ‚Äújustification‚Äù for removing the design codes as required by the USPTO. (It seems to us that keeping the design search codes is beneficial to you, since it shows that the Examining Attorney conducted a broader, wider search when considering likelihood of confusion. But the decision of whether to proceed with their removal is yours.)‚Äù
  - 2024-12-04 | Woohoo! Congratulations! That means they‚Äôre processing your application and it‚Äôs moving towards publication.

As Han said, forward that to your ip lawyer so they can respond to the Office Action.
  - 2025-01-30 | Hi Helena, the way to calculate it is to get the cost from Amazon for each shipment option when you fill out the ‚ÄúSend to Amazon‚Äù page. Then ask your shipping agent for their cost for each option. Then add the costs from Amazon and the shipping agents together for each option to compare the totals for each.

I did this with 3 different shipping agents and it always came out to be cheaper to choose the partial-shipment split option. 

But just a heads up, Amazon announced they are removing that option starting Feb 20th, 2025. So future comparisons should be easier.

Hope this helps!

  - 2025-01-15 | Hi Eleni, I suggest you adjust your shipping times for FBM orders to avoid any negative marks towards your seller account.

To adjust shipping times on Amazon FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant), go to your Seller Central account, navigate to "Settings" > "Shipping Settings" > "General Shipping Settings" where you can modify your default handling time, which determines how many business days you have to prepare and ship an order.

  - 2025-01-28 | I agree with Tom. Personally my CPC is around $2.50-$4.50 on my good kws. The product has demand and you‚Äôre exactly right that it does cut into margins. However it‚Äôs still a solid product that could‚Äôve been passed over by limiting CPC. It‚Äôs definitely something to consider though. Comparing overall demand vs avg CPC would be beneficial to help with budgeting. More info the better imo.
  - 2024-12-18 | Thank you Tom. It‚Äôs much appreciated.
  - 2024-12-11 | Yeah he DM‚Äôd me asking how much the premium membership cost. Awesome, I‚Äôll send that to him.
  - 2024-12-11 | Of course. Sounds good. I‚Äôll hold off on answering his question about membership pricing for now.
  - 2024-12-11 | 
  - 2024-12-11 | He‚Äôs the younger one of the two Khoa‚Äôs in the program.
  - 2024-12-11 | His last name isn‚Äôt shown on his username. But I believe it‚Äôs Vu.
  - 2024-12-11 | 7/17/24 was the last time we spoke then he reached out on 12/4
  - 2024-12-11 | Hi <@454372168852045844> , 
Khoa, username alycubo, joined the program in Sept 2023 shortly after I joined. He was a college student with a background in arbitrage.  


We were accountability partners up until we launched. But then he went quiet after getting suspended due to Inform ACT verification. His Amazon account is reactivated now though.

He initially reached out for tips on lowering ACOS and currently at 88%.
  - 2024-12-11 | Hi everyone, Khoa is asking how much premium membership for Shifu Discord is. I‚Äôm not sure how to answer that.
  - 2024-12-09 | Yeah that‚Äôs a very good idea. I‚Äôd hate to give them bad advice too. üò¨
  - 2024-12-09 | Yeah I was telling him to do the same. Glad I got that right üòÖ since I‚Äôm still learning PPC myself
  - 2024-12-09 | He asked to have a meeting and I gave him my availability for the weekend then he went silent üòë lol
Then this Saturday he asked for a meeting on the day of‚Ä¶ felt bad but I wasn‚Äôt able to make that work.
  - 2024-12-09 | This is a really tough situation.
  - 2024-12-09 | I believe you haha
  - 2024-12-09 | We only talked about PPC but seeing his listing now I realize he didn‚Äôt use the bundling strategy. So his offer is lacking against competitors. ü§î
  - 2024-12-09 | Ooh I see. When he first reached out to me a few weeks ago he stated he regretted joining the program. I told him he just needs to nurture his listing to increase his sales. He‚Äôs also comparing himself to others so I tried to explain that every product is different and has its seasons. I think he might need more mindset coaching and realistic expectations.
  - 2024-12-09 | Ah okay. Yeah he seemed pretty stressed. Sounds like you guys have a lot of info already then.
  - 2024-12-09 | Just an FYI, Tam reached out to me and I‚Äôm currently figuring out what his PPC strategy is since he‚Äôs been going negative. Once I get all the info I‚Äôll share it here to see how maybe Han or Susan can help him out.
  - 2024-12-07 | Just signed it.
  - 2025-01-06 | Honestly, I‚Äôm not too sure. It‚Äôs just the notes I took haha. There may be a class recording from 12/10/23. Or <@536075832658231299> can confirm.
  - 2025-01-06 | Oooh this is something I didn‚Äôt do either lol. But this is what I found from my notes from a class with Han on 12/10/23:

  - 2025-02-19 | Hi <@1059659092475531444>! I'm unfortunately stuck with getting my battery exemption sheet approved. I've worked with Minh last week on this and he's been super helpful. But Amazon has been a pain in my butt about this.
  - 2025-02-05 | Just DM you
  - 2025-02-05 | I belive I already done that the first time and it was still rejected but I'll try it again
  - 2025-02-05 | I have a recurring problem on Amazon Seller. I've been trying to get my product cleared for dangerous goods approval because my product has a battery. I've filled out the exemption sheet and uploaded to the portal several times, but it keeps coming back as "not classifed" So what can I do right now?
  - 2025-01-14 | <@1066465177140215928> no problem, looking forward to your DM!
  - 2025-01-13 | Hi <@1066465177140215928>! I would like to connect with you on your listing services! My product is currently in production and would love to get a head start on planning my listing photos and videos.
  - 2025-01-10 | So then should I get the extended warranty from my supplier then? Or just stick with the included 1 year warranty?
  - 2025-01-09 | Or do I just not mention the 1-year warranty that it already comes with it to my customers and just say it is the extended warranty that they‚Äôll claim?
  - 2025-01-09 | But about the warranty: my supplier has a 1 year warranty on my product. On my insert card, I said that customers can claim an extended warranty. Is it worth to purchase the extra year warranty from my supplier? It would be $4.8 USD/PCS.
  - 2025-01-09 | It‚Äôs not exactly a replacement part but an extra one if the current one gets dirty and have a spare one would be nice so the customer doesn‚Äôt have to wait for the current part to be cleaned and dried.
  - 2025-01-09 | When it comes to order extra or replacement parts for my products, how much should I order? My first bulk order is 300 units. I want to know your answer because I want to provide a warranty and replacement parts as an incentive on my product insert cards.
  - 2025-01-01 | Okay so I‚Äôm designing my custom packaging box now. Do I need to include the SKU barcode on my package design?
  - 2025-01-01 | So I finally made my first bulk order! The supplier is asking if I have any labels that need to be affixed to the packaging box or outer box of my goods. I‚Äôm assuming that these would be shipping labels?
  - 2025-01-01 | Happy New Year üéÜüéä
  - 2024-12-27 | Gotcha! Thank you Minh!
  - 2024-12-27 | This is what the supplier shared with me. Should I still pay via Alibaba for trade insurance or agree to their suggestion of wiring directly to their bank to avoid paying the extra Alibaba fees?
  - 2024-12-23 | Ok so I live in Virginia but that would make the shipping cost more expensive
  - 2024-12-23 | Ok so then when sharing an address with my supplier, I just choose any Amazon warehouse address in California?
  - 2024-12-23 | ok so then I just choose any Amazon warehouse address in California?
  - 2024-12-23 | Hi everyone! Apologies for the slow updates. I am finally planning to place my first bulk order. The supplier is asking for an address to an Amazon warehouse for DDP shipping. Which address should I choose? Should I choose one in California for less shipping costs?
  - 2024-12-10 | Great thank you for sharing! I will let you know if I have questions.
  - 2024-12-10 | Do I need to have brand registry done before the first bulk order? I plan to get a logo printed and custom packaging done so wasn‚Äôt sure if brand registry is done before or after placing first bulk order.
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi everyone! Thanks for checking in on me! I do have a question as I begin to choose my supplier and prepare for first bulk order.
  - 2024-10-20 | nvm I think it checked data on page 2 or something which is why it was low revenue?
  - 2024-10-20 | I just checked my product's market again today and total revenue went down to $50K. Is this something to be concerned if my product is not potential anymore?
  - 2024-10-17 | When ordering samples, it‚Äôs just to sample the product? No logo or custom box needed?
  - 2024-10-17 | I have one supplier that would only do custom box for 1000 MOQ. How important is it to have a custom box for launch?
  - 2024-10-16 | Okay thank you for your response <@1054411267340763216> and <@1066465177140215928>. I am able to negotiate down to 300 MOQ with black or gray color instead.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is it worth settling for a high MOQ of 1000 if I want to do a customized color for my product? Currently in the market, there are many black or gray colors. I noticed that the top selling competitor's product is a silver color.
  - 2024-10-14 | Did this happen because of the battery? Do I need to apply for that GTIN exemption?
  - 2024-10-14 | So should I already have found a supplier before making a dummy listing? Han said that the dummy listing doesn't need to be 100% correct so I haven't found a supplier yet.
  - 2024-10-14 | So my product has a battery, I'm not sure what type of battery and I tried to look at my competitor's listing to see if they list it but cannot find it. How should I fill out the battery questions?
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1054411267340763216> Just checking to see when you will share my product analysis for 15 and 16?
  - 2024-10-10 | ok thank you Han for answering!
  - 2024-10-10 | So I started Module 2 - Do I find a supplier first before creating a dummy listing? Minh said in the dummy listing video that I would need to get the product details like model number, etc. from the supplier.
  - 2024-10-10 | Hi <@536075832658231299>! I've completed intro module and module 1. Starting on Module 2 today.
  - 2024-11-01 | DONE <@1031622651468333076>
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi <@613172337470341150> fellow ENFP! Are you post-launch stage? Would love another accountability partner that is a stage ahead of me so that I can learn from your experience.
  - 2024-10-22 | <@1031622651468333076> Happy to be your accountability partner as your start your Amazon FBA journey!
  - 2024-10-22 | 
  - 2024-10-22 | My location is Washington, DC on the east coast. My strengths are research, mastery of online tools like Google apps & ChatGPT & project management tools like Trello. I am also an art director and graphic designer so I am opening to helping out with logo and packaging design!

  - 2025-02-12 | Here's a small win.  I always reinvested money into the business over the years.  I decided to pay myself the cashback on the card this time and buy some things for myself. üòÖ.
  - 2025-01-29 | Not much details.  A section of the product was not made as discussed.  They may have made a mistake or went cheap which affects the product's longevity.  He said it will be fine but I refused to sell it and explained it to him.  He was dismissing the issue but I let him know I was unhappy with it.  That's when he got to negotiating the replacement fees but I emphasized that it was his mistake.  Sent him multiple photos and just stood firm.   Visit my class for more info. JK üòú  You can me ask me anything.
  - 2025-01-24 | That's awesome. Glad it worked out for you.  I was in a similar situation.   They wanted me to pay half.  I said they F'd up.  They then asked me to just take care of shipping.  I was tempted but decided it wasn't my responsibility.   Eventually they agreed.
  - 2025-01-23 | That's awesome!  Love it!

  - 2025-01-17 | You don't have to worry about the sales tax as you don't receive that.  Amazon should take care of that.
  - 2025-01-17 | I didnt like that he constantly told me he will be done soon but kept lagging week after week, month after month.  We filed an extension and then he took another 6 months until that due date.   He was better before... not sure what happened.
  - 2025-01-16 | Does anyone know any good CPAs that deal with Amazon sales?  My last tax guy was lagging quite a bit so I'm looking to switch.  I'm in California.

  - 2025-02-20 | So if you gonna test new strategy from anyone. Make your data visible, experiment, analyze, make decision and repeat the loop.
  - 2025-02-20 | That's why you rarely see me give specific strategy. I gave you tools, processes and analysis instead, so you can experiment and analyze the data on your own. If anything you can take away from me, it's that.
  - 2025-02-20 | <@1213271303327453305>  <@613172337470341150> <@1168356026471436323> My 2 cents. No strategy works for every product. Experiment and use your best judgement + data analysis to make decision. Amazon ppc gives you the leverages, what you need to do is to find which ones to pull based on the data you collected and your goals.
Amazon doesn't disclose their algorithm and noone knows for sure what it really is, it's all from their own experience and experiment. So gain that for yourself.

Below is some important key points that will give you a higher chance to succeed in this journey.

1. Commiment: I know you guys have your life duties, but please commit to this journey and stay focus for the next 6 months.

2. Accountability: Keep yourself accountable, stay dedicated and put in the work required. Find an accountability partner will help as well. Remember, you're not in it alone, reach out for help when you face challenges.

3. Mindset: I wanna emphasize this is not an easy path. You willl for sure face a lot of challenges, roadblocks, and setbacks. But as long as you keep moving forward and don't quit, you'll find your way to success. Join Monday class with Shifu Charlie will help strengthening your mindset.

4. Stay Coachable: We can't teach people who don't have an open mind to learn new things. Once you get all the basic knowledge down, you can learn on your own all you want. But at first, listen to what we teach. My goal is to make you guys become more successful than me, so rest assure that I'll teach you everything I know as long as you listen.

---Thank you and let's get sh** done--

  - 2024-07-29 | Our friend finally reunited with her mother after 10 long years, but their time together was tragically cut short after only 9 months when her mom passed away unexpectedly last Thursday.
This sudden loss has left them unprepared both emotionally and financially as they were just newly college graduates and still have student loan debts.
Please join us in sending prayers and support to help her navigate this difficult time. Any prayer or contribution is genuinely appreciated.

  - 2024-12-12 | 30 max for every listing
  - 2024-12-12 | <=30
  - 2024-12-12 | that's exactly what I said during the class
  - 2024-12-11 | Second topic:
How to get more review with Vine
1. Create a entirely new listing exactly the same with your main listing
2. Send some inventory in <30
3. Sign up for Vine
4. After gettting the reviews, we can combine that new listing with the main listing under a same parent and reviews will be combine
```c
Implementation detail for step 4: Contact me when you're ready.
```
  - 2024-12-11 | 1.  Design your insert card so that it doesn't say anything related to "review, free gift". You only need 1 good reason for people to scan the qrcode. "Warranty" or "Free Ebook" is good enough. Don't include anything that could trigger their attention.
2. Inside Manychat flow, the first message is to give what you promise on the insert. You can ask for review later in the flow. We do this in case we got caught we can disconnect the later messages to prepare for an appeal.
3. Worst case if you get caught, do NOT admit anything, simply play dumb and try to appeal saying that the Insert card is a marketing strategy to give people more value in hope of referrals.
4. If they still deny, we can withdraw inventory and remove insert card then send it back, we can submit withdrawal IDs and submit prevention letter. The goal is to not lose the listing.
```cpp
Summary: Your insert card is the first gateway of them determine if you violate, so be cautious with what you put on there
```
  - 2024-12-11 | I just realized fathom wasn't working today

Manychat/Insert card design to stay safe

https://www.loom.com/share/ce696b8328c043f88ef58a1e809c8505
  - 2024-12-07 | why do you need to start a new one?
  - 2024-10-10 | yes every order goes through amazon so fbm should be on there
  - 2024-04-25 | Store name/brand name can be completely different than your business name
  - 2024-03-05 | Not really it's quite expensive. You can search on uspto website or pay a fiverr service for cheaper
  - 2024-12-20 | It's not bad enough to be a negative keyword. Don't be too strict with  them, find truly bad ones if nothing bad then don't add it
  - 2024-12-05 | 
  - 2024-12-04 | you can forward that to your ip lawyer

  - 2024-10-21 | @everyone is ppc homework too difficult this week? Not many people submitted.
  - 2024-10-08 | We'll touch base on this
  - 2024-10-08 | I already monitor your launch bids they are good
  - 2024-10-07 | It's too late to increase price maybe next time, if you want to increase price do that 2 months before prime. 
But again, why do you have to do all that for just 2 days?
  - 2024-10-07 | The minimum discount for prime is 20% so depends on your margin you can decide to keep it 20% or give a but more
  - 2024-10-04 | just use your regular campaigns, don't need to change everything for just 2 days
  - 2024-10-04 | it does, you give amazon more money basically
  - 2024-09-29 | That's too high there must be something wrong

  - 2024-10-12 | make yours better

  - 2024-10-12 | What's the issue?

  - 2025-01-14 | But it's not uncommon that fnsku is the same as the asin especially when that asin only has 1 sku just fyi
  - 2025-01-14 | System faulty I see, probably what happened was when the new variations created the system update everything
  - 2025-01-14 | It's normal
  - 2025-01-14 | Sometimes the fnsku looks the same as the asin
  - 2025-01-14 | You have to print on the exact listing you sending to
  - 2025-01-14 | So I think it's the problem with label
  - 2025-01-14 | You can mark a lower price for it to be sold out first
  - 2025-01-14 | You can just withdraw those units if you want or just leave it therr, it's under the same asin so it'll probbaly sell
  - 2025-01-14 | You don't have to delete the listing as long as you put in the correct fnsku labels
  - 2025-01-14 | Go back and check your shipment to verify #2
  - 2025-01-14 | 1. You didn't label correctly
2. You picked the wrong one during creation of shipments
  - 2025-01-14 | There are 2 scenarios I can think of
  - 2025-01-14 | Hey Trish for some reason your previous message didn't notify us
  - 2024-12-09 | Cool

  - 2024-11-28 | Yeah let's do that
  - 2024-11-28 | I think you need to add color name for the one below
  - 2024-11-28 | check on amazon.com
  - 2024-11-28 | are the listings still connected of being separated?
  - 2024-11-27 | Just make a new one and combine the 2 children again this time make sure the new parent has correct info
  - 2024-11-27 | Are u trying to change the old parent?
  - 2024-11-27 | Is that the old one that got the violation?
  - 2024-11-27 | Make sure to do it right next time
  - 2024-11-27 | You just need to keep creating the new parent
  - 2024-11-27 | It's still stuck in there but it's separated on the amazon site
  - 2024-11-27 | Yes
  - 2024-11-26 | You can try again but let's hop on a call with an amazon rep to have them look over and verify it first be fore conbining
  - 2024-11-26 | Make sure the parent matches the attribute of those 2 asins
  - 2024-11-26 | Read the bullets they give you
  - 2024-11-26 | It says removed mean they're been separated
  - 2024-11-24 | Sure no worries üëåüèª
  - 2024-11-23 | Then fill out the info required in red you should see them combined after that
  - 2024-11-23 | The goal is to combine the asins together
  - 2024-11-23 | It will create 2 extra skus for the 2 asins but you don't need to sell under those 2 new skus
  - 2024-11-23 | Use  different SKUs
  - 2024-11-23 | We just need to add the items in that bucket now
  - 2024-11-23 | The parent lising is the bucket that's all it does
  - 2024-11-23 | Think of it this way: you have 2 items that needed to be in the same bucket
  - 2024-11-23 | Note: you must keep title, bullets and everything from all listings to be the same to prevent they getting splitted later
  - 2024-11-23 | Then send me screenshot of that tab
  - 2024-11-23 | Toggle it on and go to variation tab
  - 2024-11-23 | You should see a button say "does this product have variation"
  - 2024-11-23 | Now create a new one and send me screenshot at the creation stage
  - 2024-11-23 | Okay cool
  - 2024-11-22 | They will combine all the reviews together
  - 2025-02-16 | They should know it but it's up to you to be nice
  - 2025-02-15 | That's on them then, you can advise them to buy a converter
  - 2025-02-15 | Ok they must have bought it from the us market
  - 2025-02-15 | Go to edit listing to see if it open in other marketplace
  - 2025-02-09 | Not really sinxe you're out of stock it gets worse, just keep selling you'll be ok
  - 2025-02-05 | Yeah but not during shipping from china
  - 2025-02-05 | okay let's do that
  - 2025-02-05 | I'm so lost lol, can you summarize which setting and which option you pick for each?
  - 2025-02-04 | the 3rd and 4th you have to manage returns yourself
  - 2025-02-04 | huh no, the first option is like you giving amazon full ownership
  - 2025-02-04 | yeah so by choosing the last option you basically won't get that
  - 2025-02-04 | Clcik on "damange reimburshment" to see what they say
  - 2025-02-04 | Couldn't read sorry
  - 2025-02-04 | Oh my bad it's the last option lol
  - 2025-02-03 | I would do the second one and input the Asin of that milk maker
  - 2025-02-03 | Explain them the situation you had and ask what's the difference between all the return options. And how to avoid the previous problem.
  - 2025-02-03 | It's always better to call but let's do both
  - 2025-02-02 | Talk to them and send me what they say we can discuss further
  - 2025-02-02 | I can answer you on what happened to me but it won't be applicable on you since things are different across different products
  - 2025-02-02 | Hve you talked to an amazon rep?
  - 2025-01-29 | yes
  - 2025-01-29 | I've never switched it tho but you can try and see we can always switch back so no need to stress over that
  - 2025-01-29 | It's like they won't reimbush you if there's a damage during shipment
  - 2025-01-29 | Yes this is it
  - 2025-01-29 | I guess they didn't really check thoroughly
  - 2025-01-29 | The one above is determined as "sellable" by the return department
  - 2025-01-29 | Yeah so that image only apply for: unsellable items
  - 2025-01-29 | Did you set it as not grade/resell?
  - 2025-01-29 | So probably what happened was they don't check what's in the box and assume based on the reason title
  - 2025-01-29 | It says unwanted item here?
  - 2025-01-29 | Most likely that item is still unopened
  - 2025-01-12 | It is quite random
  - 2025-01-12 | It may come back
  - 2025-01-12 | Referral fee discount
  - 2025-01-12 | They gave you discount for amazon fee before
  - 2024-10-28 | If not you can give support rep a call
  - 2024-10-28 | Quick check on other marketplace to see if you run ppc on any other market
  - 2024-10-28 | did you put cogs on sellerboard?

  - 2024-10-23 | You can ship the remaining to your house then ship it back in amazon later
  - 2025-02-08 | Can you contact brand registry?
  - 2025-02-08 | That's odd
  - 2025-02-06 | is the new one working?
  - 2025-02-06 | not yet
  - 2025-02-05 | Can you create a new asin to see if that happen again?
  - 2025-02-05 | Hmm
  - 2025-02-05 | When you created the asin did you type in your brand name or selected from the drop down?
  - 2024-12-16 | It's something you have to have at some point
  - 2024-12-16 | 500 is ok but if you want less risky we can skip customization for the first batch
  - 2024-12-13 | @AliceSvensson  "Super happy I could join class today, thanks for a intresting class.  Just one question... I know that you often dosent recommend launching the product in differens variations or colours. Is it much more difficult? Should I go with just one colour to start with? Even if I think that it will add more value to my offer if I can sell my product in different colours?" 
Launching variations is possible but it requires more work and capital invested, which is why we don't recommend unless there's a strong reason that makes it make sense
we can always add more variation later if needed
but again, it depends, we can't launch a shirt with just size Medium
But generally speaking, your first product is better to just have 1 variation because you still need time to learn and having multiple variations will just make it harder
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-12 | 
  - 2024-12-09 | With that being said, find a way to elevate your offer to make it more appealing than other guys
  - 2024-12-09 | It's a UPC code.
Yes you need one since a similar product is on amazon but it's not under your brand that means the one under you brand is a different on even though both have no difference. That's basically the definition of private label
  - 2024-11-10 | Can you send the analysis sheet for this one?
  - 2024-11-09 | ik it's a bit discouraging but I rather let you go slow than pursue something that is not worth the effort with high risk of failure
  - 2024-11-09 | we can make exception if the market is super potential which is rare
  - 2024-11-09 | yeah usually fragile products are no-gos for beginners
  - 2025-02-21 | They always say that first, you may wanna hire a fiverr service to help
  - 2025-02-21 | I mean a video we can use to run ad
  - 2025-02-21 | Do you have a video we can use? Also check if they ban you from sponsored brand
  - 2025-02-21 | Let see what they respond
  - 2025-02-21 | say that your product is just water bottle nothing about it is weight loss
  - 2025-02-21 | yeah
  - 2025-02-21 | we can run some video ad at the moment if they haven't banned you from that yet
  - 2025-02-21 | do it asap since this may take some time
  - 2025-02-21 | I could walk you through that process but let's change it and contact them first
  - 2025-02-21 | and say something like announce the whole company to acknowledge that and fire the one responsible
  - 2025-02-21 | blame it on "your marketing team"
  - 2025-02-21 | yeah revert back to what was working is a safe bet but contact them and explain, you may have to write a preventive actions letter
  - 2025-02-21 | worst case we can create a new asin and merge them together as variations to keep the reviews, but it'll be expensive since you may have to relabel
  - 2025-02-21 | it may take a while but be patient, don't mess it up again they could block you from advertising for good
  - 2025-02-21 | avoid targeting those keywords in your campaign as well
  - 2025-02-21 | change your copywriting and contact them asap to appeal it
  - 2025-02-21 | I got this before
  - 2025-02-21 | yeah you could be banned from just advertising
  - 2025-02-18 | No need to close now since it's already in
  - 2025-02-12 | $.10/download or sth lol
  - 2025-02-12 | Free marketing for them for x amount
  - 2025-02-12 | And cut a deal with them
  - 2025-02-12 | Contact those free app owners
  - 2025-02-12 | Since your customers are most likely concerned about their health lol
  - 2025-02-12 | https://www.ondemand.labcorp.com
  - 2025-02-12 | Buy them a free test from these sites
  - 2025-02-12 | I would do sth like this
  - 2025-02-12 | It should be something that can work ob top of your bottle like detecting how much people drink from the bottle a day or sth. But that won't be easy to make
  - 2025-02-12 | How can it be a value added if it's already available for free?
But then you can just add a link one for ios one for android
  - 2025-02-12 | You have the app ready to download?
  - 2025-02-06 | But looks like you were improving back in 2024 it's a good sign
  - 2025-02-06 | Use the new 2025 sheet for 2025 data
  - 2025-02-06 | This is 2024 have you done 2025?
  - 2025-01-30 | let's hop on here I have 30min
  - 2025-01-30 | https://us06web.zoom.us/j/9909988899?pwd=A6vs8IkrEllsmmDC7jTl7vm4ei0Vry.1
  - 2025-01-30 | I can hop on a quick call to check that
  - 2025-01-30 | nothing to be worried here, as long as you set the deliver window right it should be ok
  - 2025-01-30 | you can update the tracking later tho unless they take a super longg break
  - 2025-01-30 | 1. Yeah since you already pick UPS at the beginning, inputting FedEx tracking won't help Amazon track the shipment, but it's ok just input it there to avoid warning, they'll receive it anyway.
2. If it's still use the same shipment label/ID it may still be ok but I guess that's not the case here. Missing 1 unit is ok tho no biggie
  - 2025-01-25 | Cool
  - 2025-01-22 | Do you plan to have both variations selling moving forward? Or it's permanently added on top?
  - 2025-01-16 | just don't give admin access and access to finance
  - 2025-01-16 | yeah
  - 2025-01-14 | But let's move as fast as you can
  - 2025-01-14 | I can't predict that but usually even when it's deactivated we can still get it back
  - 2025-01-22 | Or you can just make a removal for like 10 units to see how much it cost
  - 2025-01-22 | It should be a little bit cheaper when you actually do the removal but it should give you an estimate
  - 2025-01-22 | It should give you the cost for 1 unit then you can multiply
  - 2025-01-22 | Can you make an MCF order to your address?
  - 2025-01-14 | Pick one and go with it and accept the worst case scenario while working on the best case
  - 2025-01-14 | You can't have your foot on both sides like that it will end up hurting you more
  - 2025-01-14 | But I discussed this with you before
  - 2025-01-14 | It will be quite expensive
  - 2024-12-17 | also don't you already have a brand on amazon?
  - 2024-12-17 | can you send a screenshot
  - 2024-12-17 | where does it ask you?
  - 2024-12-11 | As long as you can put up with it I have no problem
  - 2024-12-11 | Okay nothing wrong with trying
  - 2024-12-11 | So there may be still some work there with the requirements
  - 2024-12-11 | The thing is the category is for kids
  - 2024-12-11 | That may trigger the same issue back then
  - 2024-12-11 | Be careful of using sensitive words
  - 2024-12-11 | With the new listing creation now
  - 2024-12-11 | I just need more context since what we last spoken confused me a bit
  - 2024-12-11 | It's ok
  - 2024-12-11 | Generic won't give you that
  - 2024-12-11 | It gives you A+ content
  - 2024-12-11 | If you can still use the brand them why not
  - 2024-12-11 | What's the issue with the brand? Is it removed from sellercentral?
  - 2024-12-11 | Have you tried create a listing with your brand name on?
  - 2024-12-11 | Did you withdraw them?
  - 2024-12-11 | Those units stuck in the old listing right?
  - 2024-12-11 | Are we gonna try to sell it on amazon?
  - 2024-12-11 | Tell me what's your plan is
  - 2025-01-09 | when you have the volume of order, it's easier to make a deal with supplier
  - 2025-01-09 | we can always change it later
  - 2025-01-09 | you won't have a bunch of traffic at first so worrying about it now is not neccessary
  - 2025-01-09 | let's make it easy sis, just give them a warranty, if anything happen just send them a new unit
  - 2024-10-17 | 1000 is a bit too much stay under 500. If neccessary you can skip box design first batch
  - 2024-10-14 | Composition: Lithium Ion
Regulation: Not applicable
  - 2024-10-14 | apply for GTIN exemption
  - 2024-10-10 | You can do it now no need waiting for supplier
  - 2024-10-10 | The goal is to see is there any requirements for that product
  - 2024-10-10 | And model number is basically what you decide it to be so it doesn't really matter
  - 2024-10-10 | Dummy listing doesn't need to be correct 100%
  - 2024-10-10 | done
  - 2025-02-20 | Yeah there's uncertainty especially when you don't have last year data, but having separate camps is good, continue to run and optimize them
  - 2025-02-20 | Best way is still to have them separated for better control.
Also short term sales don't tell much gotta test longer but if you already have them separate let's keep it that way
  - 2025-01-07 | I always ignore those offers so I don't think I can give you advice on this. Maybe Chuong or Justin know
  - 2024-12-04 | change the original if needed
  - 2024-12-04 | ehh no it has to be exactly the same
  - 2024-12-04 | and other info as well
  - 2024-12-04 | but the text should be the same
  - 2024-12-04 | picture can be different
  - 2024-12-04 | then we can combine it with the original
  - 2024-12-04 | after you have that make sure it doesn't have any restriction
  - 2024-12-04 | with new UPC
  - 2024-12-04 | yes
  - 2024-12-04 | it should be almost exactly the same as the original (title, desc, keywords, etc)
  - 2024-12-04 | now create an entire new listing for the second variation
  - 2024-12-04 | ok keep that original one
  - 2024-12-04 | the original one
  - 2024-12-04 | is your main listing still up?
  - 2024-12-04 | ok let's do it again
  - 2024-12-04 | uh oh
  - 2024-12-04 | how did you create the variation
  - 2024-12-04 | let's ignore that amazon support part
  - 2024-12-04 | did you create a new listing then combine them?
  - 2024-12-04 | how did you do this part?
  - 2024-12-04 | download that form first
  - 2024-12-04 | if you can send some screenshots here I can help over text

  - 2024-11-30 | but it shouldn't be that hard
  - 2024-11-30 | download that file and see what's in it I never created variations via file before
  - 2024-11-30 | looks like they want you to submit via a file
  - 2024-11-11 | Well nothing wrong with negotiating for better price
  - 2024-11-11 | You have to keep up with returns if doing fbm
  - 2024-11-11 | And the volume is low so you can defo do that on your own
  - 2024-11-11 | I think for now you can try some fbm to get farmiliar with it before using a 3PL
  - 2025-02-19 | But please do a new sheet every time for poc tracker don't override the previous one
  - 2025-02-19 | Target 50% is good
  - 2025-02-19 | Hey Kazoua, I saw the request and sent the result
  - 2025-02-08 | But if they do ask you can print sale report from Amazon

  - 2025-02-02 | Let's just hop on a call to save time
  - 2025-02-02 | Every campaign you must export 1 targeting sheet that either has keywords or asins
  - 2025-02-02 | The targeting tab I told you above is under each campaign
  - 2025-02-02 | Oh I see the confusion now
  - 2025-02-01 | Can you send me the screenshot where you downloaded it
  - 2025-02-01 | It's under targetings under the adgroup
  - 2025-02-01 | It's not the right one you downloaded from
  - 2025-01-30 | lmk if you can't figure that out, I'll hop on a quick zoom call
  - 2025-01-30 | send me the .csv here first to verify before submitting the request
  - 2025-01-30 | you have to go to the Target tab where it shows all the keywords with the bids
  - 2025-01-30 | <@1256245998255345695> what you submitted wasn't right
  - 2025-01-30 | Did you read <#1266234579501580320> ? Follow the step then Submit a form and it will email you the result
  - 2025-01-30 | You must use the ppc assisant it will give you the output for every single keyword
  - 2025-01-29 | Below is what target acos I recommend you set
Exact - 40% (0.4)
Phrase - 55% (0.55)
The rest - 0.6

You don't have to optimize the Ultimate
  - 2025-01-29 | Based on your tracking let's use <#1266234579501580320>
  - 2025-01-29 | <@1256245998255345695> let's start communicating here
  - 2025-01-23 | but don';t use that one for the data visibility sheet since it's delayed
  - 2025-01-23 | yeah it's the cost of ad
  - 2025-01-23 | You mean for the spend column?
  - 2025-01-22 | Do you use it for fbm order on amazon? I'd say just go ahead and do it
  - 2025-01-22 | Nothing we can do here it's FBA so leave it for Amazon
  - 2025-01-21 | if you need UPS intergration with your seller account ,yes
  - 2025-01-14 | Nvm I'm on time
  - 2025-01-14 | I may be later a little bit
  - 2025-01-12 | It's general slow around this time
  - 2025-01-12 | We don't need to wait for those units to launch
  - 2025-01-12 | Booking
https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/booking/sZzWsC5MEcbtRRfgawqU?user_id=tvtAHbbVDvky72E3b3rr
  - 2025-01-12 | Sure make sure you have enought available units before the launch date
  - 2025-01-08 | Don't include medical, or any weight lost promise
  - 2025-01-08 | Be careful with this product try avoid sensitive kws and images
  - 2024-11-20 | you should see an email by now i did it this morning
  - 2024-11-18 | drop 1 sheet per 1 "Attach file"
  - 2024-11-18 | 
  - 2024-11-18 | if they have the same then just repeat
  - 2024-11-18 | because you may have different target acos for each sheet
  - 2024-11-18 | if you have more than 5 you can do another submission
  - 2024-11-18 | I leave 5 sections for you
  - 2024-11-18 | Thy, the sheets look good but can you submit 1 sheet per section?
  - 2024-11-18 | can you send me one sheet you downloaded from one campaign here
  - 2024-11-18 | or Amazon may have changed it
  - 2024-11-18 | the columns should look something like this
  - 2024-11-18 | 
  - 2024-11-18 | if you have multiple files just upload multiple files
  - 2024-11-18 | the tool needs to look at what is exactly generated originally from Amazon to understand
  - 2024-11-18 | the column Keyword has "- exact" for example
  - 2024-11-18 | I saw you combine multiple files into one?
  - 2024-11-17 | <@1212159958976827482> just got your ppc assistant request, please submit again don't change anything on the downloaded files, submit the files as they are
  - 2024-11-12 | Yeah it shouldn't be a big issue just don't repeat that too often
  - 2024-11-08 | you have to delete the listing and relist to update it
  - 2024-11-08 | there is but since you just launch let's not do it now
  - 2024-10-21 | yes
  - 2024-10-11 | smh
  - 2024-10-11 | what the hell is that
  - 2024-10-11 | former ghost writer in action
  - 2024-10-11 | I usually not really care if they leave bad review but since your brand is new let's not risk it lol
  - 2024-10-11 | ok so maybe just cut loss then lol
  - 2024-10-11 | lol
  - 2024-10-11 | 1 star amazon review?
  - 2024-10-11 | what can he do?
  - 2024-10-11 | but if you think the amount is not worth it then it's ok to cut loss but I don't like this guy based on what you provided
  - 2024-10-11 | not really, if you pay through paypal they will just withdraw his money if he can't prove that he fulfill the work
  - 2024-10-11 | gather all the email
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah let's dsipute it
  - 2024-10-11 | did you pay via "service" or "friend and family"
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah you can dispute it on paypal
  - 2024-10-11 | <@728408607510626444>  here
  - 2024-12-09 | Usually 2 weeks is recommended if you concern about ad spend just reduce your budget and set lower target
  - 2024-12-09 | I optimized both anyways
  - 2024-11-20 | yeah let's add the rest in
  - 2024-10-29 | your margin is already super low right now, I don't think dropping price is a good option
  - 2024-10-29 | result sent
  - 2024-10-29 | we can try to boost ppc but it may be very expensive
  - 2024-10-28 | I'm not mentioning anything about generating keywords
  - 2024-10-28 | go to the targeting tab on the campaign(where you see all the keywords) to download the csv
  - 2024-10-28 | no the sheet you used to submit the second form was wrong
  - 2024-10-25 | you have to go to where the keywords are to export
  - 2024-10-25 | for ppc assistant
  - 2024-10-25 | <@809813064756887582> the sheet in the second form you uploaded is not correct
  - 2024-10-23 | Looks good I'll send the result soon
  - 2024-10-21 | yed
  - 2024-10-19 | Hey brother did you book 2 slot on Tuesday?
  - 2024-10-18 | Just optimize like normal, submit the form
  - 2024-10-15 | But well you can use the one Susan sent
  - 2024-10-15 | You have to duplicate it
  - 2024-10-15 | It'll be different for everyone instead use ppc tracker along with pppc assistant and practice with ppc homework

  - 2025-02-11 | I don't have time tmr Hannah, sr. Can you schedule a call
  - 2025-01-23 | Hey Hannah would love to help but my account can't leave reviews anymore lol
  - 2025-01-10 | Hannah, the team also notice that you have stopped joining classes. I understand that you are working directly with the founders. However, for the normal progress of your first time launching, going with our team is still your best option to avoid unnecessary mistakes.
Please start joining classes again a stay engage with our team (Minh, Susan, Jamie, me).
Thank you
  - 2025-01-10 | for the partner/nonpartner option pick nonparter since it's your shipping agent not amazon partner
  - 2025-01-10 | They should ship your bulk order to amazon warehouse, you can pick the multiple warehouse option to save fee
  - 2025-01-07 | Hmm <@1054411267340763216> can check on that for you
  - 2025-01-06 | but if you just created your listing it may not be there yet, if your product has battery you need to submit battery exemption in order print shipping label
  - 2025-01-06 | FNSKU should be under the 3 dot on your listing "Print item label"
  - 2025-01-06 | the Amazon UI changedd recently so that may cause some confusion
  - 2025-01-06 | Do you have our syllabus, the steps are on the syllabus, if you still can't find it <@1054411267340763216> can send a quick tutorial or jump on a call with you
  - 2025-01-06 | But still you need to do keyword research to pick what should be on there so keyword research/selection is what we need here
  - 2025-01-06 | One thing that can help is keyword indexing on your listing copywriting, it's similar to SEO, I think you already know
  - 2025-01-06 | 2 different products on 2 different categories but if they bid on the same keyword the price doesn't change between them. If that makes sense
  - 2025-01-06 | It's not about the category but the keywords selection.
You can test the bid price using #1 method Susan said above
  - 2025-01-05 | Your listing will get indexed correctly after a while of selling
  - 2025-01-05 | Technically category doesn't affect your growth or anything, usually you can just copy your competitor's category
  - 2024-11-19 | Yeah google the closest one to you to get sn estimate but the exact one will be when you create the shipment
  - 2024-12-15 | We should have one I can teach again in class that one may be outdated
  - 2024-12-09 | I plan to make it a better tool that can remember each person numbers and make better optimization each time
  - 2024-12-09 | I don't wanna expose it to everyone yet just for Yellow members for now
  - 2024-12-09 | <#1266234579501580320> it's in here
  - 2024-12-09 | I suggest if you see a person don't know what they're doing, let's tell them to just use ppc-assistant while practice more ob ppc homework. Telling them phrases like "cut bleeders" will just confuse them <@308107877493768193> <@297667891992723457> 
For Tam, it's a hard case, 10% margin before ppc is just too little. He'll be in red for a while unless he can increase his margin somehow.
  - 2024-12-07 | all good now

  - 2024-10-11 | Product Analysis | Keyword Analysis | Listing Creation Request form
https://airtable.com/appMORc7BoAe5FJHc/shrkIAxsYMxMG95ru
  - 2025-02-19 | You don't need to wait it's just the SKU, as long as the ASIN is good we can create as many SKU as we wish
  - 2025-02-19 | Create a new FBA condition on the ASIN
  - 2024-12-24 | Check your email
  - 2024-12-23 | Don't use the previous one since it's incorrect
  - 2024-12-23 | <@1196333933814612000> did you do it yet?
  - 2024-12-19 | can you do that again
  - 2024-12-19 | so instead of 50 -> input 0.5
  - 2024-12-19 | the target acos is in decimal form
  - 2024-12-19 | your request to ppc assistant was not correct
  - 2024-12-19 | <@1196333933814612000> hey Joise
  - 2024-10-13 | Done, check your email
  - 2024-10-13 | I will adjust it for you
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1196333933814612000> you set target too low
  - 2024-10-13 | I'll run the optimization for you in a bit
  - 2024-10-13 | Auto looks decent which is a good sign
  - 2024-10-13 | Just send the link to your tracker no need screenshot actually
  - 2024-10-13 | Ah I see we may bid too low
  - 2024-10-13 | Send a screenshot of your ppc tracker here
  - 2024-10-13 | I'll look at your ppc request
  - 2024-10-13 | By performing you mean spend with no sale or just low spend?
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1196333933814612000> here
  - 2024-11-04 | Reach out to us and give me some weekly activities to keep you accountable
  - 2024-10-28 | but you can consult with Justin on this to see what's his opinion is
  - 2024-10-28 | Since it's your first product, I'm leaning toward the later. Take a bit more time to find a better market with less restriction while building up your experience with Amazon
  - 2024-10-28 | on the other hand, staying away from this market can save you a lot of headache later down the road
  - 2024-10-28 | It's a bit hard to give the right answer in this case, as moving forward with that supplier inherit some risk, but of course it'll continue your progress with less disruption
  - 2024-10-21 | They had a system glitch a few dys ago
  - 2024-10-21 | Let's open an appeal under account health
  - 2024-10-21 | When you created the dummy listing tryna void sensitive words I think Minh has a word list to stay away fron <@1054411267340763216>
  - 2024-10-21 | Ah this is a common issue but it may get tricky
  - 2024-10-19 | what's the issue that makes them inactice?
  - 2024-11-18 | but aim to lower it if you can
  - 2024-11-18 | 10% is not too bad for electronics
  - 2024-11-15 | yeah do that
  - 2024-11-15 | I though it's like $10 increase
  - 2024-11-15 | let's just do 99.99
  - 2024-11-15 | ah ok not much
  - 2024-11-15 | remind me about that I'll do it during class
  - 2024-11-15 | check your keyword ranking using helium10 listing analizer (I may need to do a tutorial)

  - 2024-12-14 | No need you can use the same brand
  - 2024-12-13 | You can put a sticker on the box but for listing on Amazon you must use a branded listing
  - 2024-12-03 | it's from Olesia, you can ask her for more details
  - 2024-12-03 | https://www.fiverr.com/s/xXj3jDQ
  - 2024-12-03 | yes let me ask for you
  - 2024-12-03 | let's use a fiverr service to resolve it
  - 2024-12-03 | your listing may contains some keyword that trigger the violation
  - 2024-11-09 | Keep it simple,
  - 2024-11-09 | Wait until the new stock coming and turn everything back on to where they were before
  - 2024-11-09 | But unless you're running out of stock
  - 2024-11-09 | It's like starting over
  - 2024-11-09 | Don't turn off anything keep the originals
  - 2024-11-09 | if you not sure what target ACOS to give to the assistant just post your ppc tracker here I can give suggestion
  - 2024-11-09 | to make it easier, bring it back up to where it was before, every 2 weeks do ppc tracker and use ppc assistant
  - 2024-11-09 | which explains why your sale is sinking
  - 2024-11-09 | you can monitor every but don't adjust it too often or your listing will slowly die
  - 2024-11-09 | even couple days still over optimizing
  - 2024-11-09 | instagram: use meta business and schedule posts. You can spend a day to schedule 30 posts a month
  - 2024-11-09 | fbm reviews: not that hard just write a bunch of reviews in advance
  - 2024-11-09 | ppc you only optimize once every 2 weeks, don't tell me you optimize everyday?
  - 2024-11-08 | give me 3 things that take up the most of your time (from Amazon)
  - 2024-11-08 | other than that just monitor your account 15min a day, you don't need a VA now
  - 2024-11-08 | well, you can keep things minimal with ppc assistant once every 2 weeks
  - 2024-11-08 | Hi <@1213335800205414452> sorry missed your text
  - 2024-10-23 | Yes you can but should you?

  - 2024-10-16 | <@1052316774227529748> can you post the DM in here so our team can also see it?
  - 2024-11-21 | It's a hard question depends on your capital, but you can do inventory management homework to calculate what's the ideal quantity should be
  - 2024-11-21 | Yeah we'll close the listings and pause camps
  - 2024-11-21 | Optmize your campaigns now I think you can turn off BF sale
  - 2024-11-21 | They should idk why they take so long
  - 2024-11-21 | Isn't it good news?
  - 2024-11-21 | I think you'll sell out even without BF discount
  - 2024-11-21 | How many inventory do you have?
  - 2024-11-21 | Set aside 30min it shouldn't take that long
  - 2024-11-21 | Do it asap
  - 2024-11-21 | And btw why don't you share in win this is huge
  - 2024-11-21 | Since this is your first batch just keep it growing no need to over optimize

  - 2025-02-05 | Yeah I think you may have lost the keyword ranking
  - 2025-02-04 | You may wanna increase ppc to bring the keyword ranking back up
  - 2025-02-04 | Search for a keyword and go through pages to check it may not be on first page tho
  - 2025-02-03 | how did you test if it searchable?
  - 2025-02-03 | if it's not searchable how come you get clicks?

  - 2025-02-02 | This is too confusing, we can hop on a quick call to check
  - 2025-02-02 | You may put 149.99 somewhere, probably under sale price section that's what I mean.
  - 2025-02-02 | You have 2 SKUs there 1 is lower price
  - 2025-02-02 | No it's not forcing you to do a sale
  - 2025-02-01 | Remove sale price under Edit
  - 2025-02-01 | Did you type the brandname in or select from the dropdown when creating the listing?
  - 2025-01-24 | Feb, July and Nov
  - 2025-01-24 | Amazon usually run massive check I think I covered this before in class
  - 2025-01-24 | It's a clean out month for them you're not the only one
  - 2025-01-24 | Talk to at least 2-3 of them to see which one can help you on that particular issue. I think it's just a mistake fron Amazon and will be resolved
  - 2025-01-24 | They usually write better appeal/response
  - 2025-01-24 | Hey Mercede let's go on Fiverr and search for listing violation service
  - 2025-01-20 | There's a way around it but it's messy
  - 2025-01-20 | You can't have 2 accounts they will ban both
  - 2025-01-19 | Just focus on what we can control
  - 2025-01-19 | Yeah we can't do much on that

  - 2025-01-19 | Oh back in December
  - 2025-01-19 | Did you havr the "Color" showed up  last time?
  - 2025-01-19 | That's weird <@1212209797345185883> , can you send a ticket to amazon? I guess there's a system glitch.

  - 2025-01-06 | If it's above 100 you can increase a little and same if it's below 50 you can decrease a little
  - 2025-01-06 | Generaly $.25 is a good start if your product price is around 50-100
  - 2024-12-31 | same SKU but same ASIN will still have it
  - 2024-12-31 | yeah the badge is attached on the ASIN so new variation won't have it
  - 2024-11-25 | hey Lowell any update?
  - 2024-10-30 | for ppc optimization, 
1. Look at ppc homework 1 and do about 20-50 keywords
2. Compare with the result
3. If you don't get most of it right -> use ppc assistant as your optimization tool while you're practice more
  - 2024-10-30 | also, navigate to homeowork and do Data visibility homework and send that to me as well
  - 2024-10-30 | can you watch ppc tracker and fill that out and send it to me?
  - 2024-10-30 | What's high ACOS? 100%?

  - 2024-11-20 | Did you wait?
  - 2024-11-15 | Delete and wait mean you removing it from Amazon catalog
  - 2024-11-15 | No download the one say: Add the one NOT in Amazon catalog
  - 2024-11-15 | Make sure to use microsoft excel
  - 2024-11-15 | When you choose the product type it should show the red boxes
  - 2024-11-15 | All red ones are needed
  - 2024-11-15 | let's delete and do it again this time send me screenshot of the sheet first before uploading
  - 2024-11-15 | also did you mark Update under Update/Delete column?
  - 2024-11-15 | don't fill the whole thing
  - 2024-11-15 | just fill out the red outlined ones
  - 2024-11-15 | usually we don't need to fill out the inventory part
  - 2024-11-13 | and upload the file
  - 2024-11-13 | wait at least 24 hours
  - 2024-11-13 | then delete it
  - 2024-11-13 | then take some screenshot from the listing jsut in case
  - 2024-11-13 | it's safe to download and fill out the sheet first make sure everything correct
  - 2024-11-13 | ok then back to the deleting and reuploading method
  - 2024-11-13 | that's why I'm asking do you have to use that one
  - 2024-11-13 | then you must use the same ASIN then
  - 2024-11-13 | if it's still the same ASIN then it's not gonna work
  - 2024-11-13 | you can tryI'm not sure what you mean by copy
  - 2024-11-13 | it's much easier that way
  - 2024-11-13 | well then just create a new one if you haven't done anything with that old one
  - 2024-11-13 | you're not selling on that listing right
  - 2024-11-13 | no need to delete you can just leave it there
  - 2024-11-13 | then just create a new one tho
  - 2024-11-13 | do you HAVE TO use that same listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | that sheet is tricky lmk if you got stuck
  - 2024-11-13 | fill the ones outlined in red color
  - 2024-11-13 | anything that has the arrow must be picked not typed in
  - 2024-11-13 | fill out the template: you must use Microsoft Excel for this

  - 2025-01-03 | It shouldn't
  - 2025-02-06 | Let me try again
  - 2025-02-06 | Ok
  - 2025-02-06 | I saw your request but create a new one
  - 2025-02-06 | Exact and asin do 0.5 (50%) target acos
The rest do 0.4
No need to optimize ultimate
  - 2025-02-06 | Nice you can do ppc assistant now
  - 2025-01-24 | 3. Not really from now just do optimization bi-weekly
  - 2025-01-24 | You can pause on those campaign since the launch is new
  - 2025-01-23 | don't need to optimize the ultimate
  - 2025-01-23 | The rest do 45%
  - 2025-01-23 | For auto and asin do 80% (0.8) target acos

  - 2025-01-18 | Hi <@139948452363763712> are you launching next Thursday?
  - 2025-01-07 | Ok
  - 2025-01-07 | Pause it for now
  - 2024-12-06 | 1. numbers are relative, you can prepare the sheet for Minh to check
2. it requires more work but doable, just make sure it's potential enough to take the risk
3. you can start llc, biz cc can be later after you find a potential product
  - 2024-12-01 | If it aids you on product research you can keep it otherwise we don't require anything beside Helium10
  - 2024-12-01 | What are the other 2 for? Product research?
  - 2024-11-30 | Yes you can do that to save fee now just remember to switch it later
  - 2024-12-26 | You may have to use other shipping method like DHL but you need to have inventory on hand
  - 2024-12-26 | I don't think you can do international with MCF
  - 2024-12-21 | Sorry you have to go through this but let's work through this ok
  - 2024-12-21 | Yeah turn off your flow it should be safe
  - 2024-12-21 | That's why I said you can just ship back in
  - 2024-12-21 | Yub
  - 2024-12-21 | Yeah at least until you can replace all the insert with new design just to be safe
  - 2024-12-21 | Maybe try half first
  - 2024-12-21 | For the withdrawl ones you can just ship back in without removing the insert but if you wanna have peace of mind you can ask the 3Pl to remove them but it may be very expensive
  - 2024-12-21 | Just don't use the manychat flow
  - 2024-12-21 | Just continue selling those it's ok
  - 2024-12-20 | Did they say how can you get your listing reinstated?
  - 2024-12-20 | Wait, they didn't reinstate your listing?
  - 2024-12-20 | Where did you withdraw them to?
  - 2024-12-19 | How do they know which one scan thr qr and which ones didn't
  - 2024-12-19 | Contact all of your reviewers?
  - 2024-12-19 | Yeah maybe 2-3
  - 2024-12-19 | I don't think amazon know who they are just submit 1-2
  - 2024-12-19 | Are all 40+ actually left a review?
  - 2024-12-18 | Are the fiverr people gonna help you write the letter?
  - 2024-12-18 | Letting the account deactivated for too long is not good
  - 2024-12-18 | Ok let's accept it and do the removal
  - 2024-12-17 | What's his suggested solution?
  - 2024-12-17 | Let's try that
  - 2024-12-17 | tell them that even thought you get the ID but you didn't ask for a review
  - 2024-12-17 | ok let's just submit some order ID that didn't give you a review for them
  - 2024-12-16 | You didn't use it for review so submitting them mean you admit those are id you collect reviews
  - 2024-12-16 | But they ask for Id that assocciate with review
  - 2024-12-16 | For order ID you can just simply say you don't collect order ID you just giving out warranty cards
  - 2024-12-16 | Can you contact this person

  - 2025-01-27 | https://us06web.zoom.us/j/9909988899?pwd=A6vs8IkrEllsmmDC7jTl7vm4ei0Vry.1
  - 2025-01-27 | ok cool
  - 2025-01-27 | is it ready?
  - 2025-01-27 | oh yes, I though you were still at listing creation
  - 2025-01-27 | Hey <@1225664394923348019> is our call today launch call or the account issue?
  - 2025-02-17 | Yeah you can add that too
  - 2025-02-17 | it should take them to their order history to leave a review
  - 2025-02-17 | <@1147584732440309760> the flow is ok but the link for "Leaave Review" button is not correct
  - 2025-02-17 | Ok I'll check it in the morning not on my desk rn
  - 2025-02-17 | Ok with some screenshots of the flow
  - 2025-02-17 | https://airtable.com/appMORc7BoAe5FJHc/shrDjtsMT2pTl17iW
  - 2025-02-17 | submit a form for that
  - 2025-02-17 | it's our normal process
  - 2025-02-17 | ok make sure those are ready, keyword reviewed and revised, have about 100 unit available. Then you can launch
  - 2025-02-17 | usually Susan will give you a green light when you're fully prepared
  - 2025-02-17 | not just that, did you have your keyword reviewed and listing ready?
  - 2025-02-17 | are you ready to launch <@1147584732440309760> ?
  - 2025-01-26 | You can just have 2 versions in case amazon doesn't like it
  - 2025-01-26 | Who will? QA is usually pretty random
  - 2025-01-24 | 
  - 2025-01-13 | Hmm what course are you looking at?
  - 2025-01-13 | Be careful with the design
  - 2025-01-13 | Before doing that watch my manychat videos
  - 2025-01-13 | You can use Canva
  - 2025-01-13 | <@1147584732440309760> since you're back at it, please start communicate here with our team if there's private information
  - 2025-02-20 | I know they will have new models just keep on looking and give yourself a time frame for that
  - 2025-02-20 | yeah test them out to see
  - 2025-02-20 | Give yourself a time frame you can always offer the new model as a 2nd product
  - 2025-02-20 | But manufacturers usually have new models if the market is trending since they also compete with each other
  - 2025-02-20 | But if you can't find anything it's ok to offer the same model but make your offer stronger
  - 2025-02-20 | Well the best option is still standing out with a different/better model
  - 2025-02-20 | It's ok
  - 2025-02-20 | Storefront address can be different. It's ok don't make disruption, have your account verified first we can always call them to make changes later if needed (don't change it without notifying them)
  - 2025-02-11 | yeah
  - 2025-02-08 | Hi khoa only use 1 file for each section please
  - 2025-02-06 | This message got pushed so far so I just post it here again.
Note: for ppc questions please ask in ‚Å†launch-support 
I want to use this channel to collect feedback to improve the tool. Thank you guys.

  - 2025-02-07 | Hi all, my fba is now showing active and looks like I'm not able to sell my FBM and send empty packages to my friends and family anymore. Amazon said I can't turn off FBA and just sell fbm... anyone encounter this issue? And is there a way around this? I don't want the product sent and also have to reimburse them.ü•∫
  - 2025-02-06 | Ok, thank you
  - 2025-02-06 | HI All. Was wondering if most of the orders/reviews are from the state you live in, is that a red flag with Amazon?

  - 2025-01-24 | I input the tracking number in Amazon - and it can't locate it. I talked to someone and they said I have to cancel the order and redo it. However, Roseanna said they've already shipped about 10-7 days ago.
  - 2025-01-24 | Has anyone had issues with tracking your order with the tracking number provided by Macy's shipping team?

  - 2025-02-11 | The rest of my product is schedule to arrive this week, but status still shows shipment created. Is this normal with the tracking? Not much updates?
  - 2025-02-11 | <@536075832658231299> when should I schedule the pre-launch call with you?
  - 2025-02-11 | Thank you @han and <@1066465177140215928> !
  - 2025-02-07 | NVM - Susan helped me with this already in DM. Thank you!
  - 2025-02-07 | So what do you do when you're trying to sell fbm and send the empty boxes? Is there any way around this? Amazon said no. The Buyer doesn't have an option to pick FBA
  - 2025-02-07 | they said I can turn off the listing for fba but if I don't turn it back in time, then the order for fba will be removed
  - 2025-02-07 | I asked amazon if I can turn off the FBA and finish selling my fbm since I only have 6 left
  - 2025-02-07 | <@1054411267340763216> <@536075832658231299> I asked a friend to order my product yesterday and although my FBA haven't been completely processed, they ordered fba somehow
  - 2025-02-04 | Got it. Thank you!
  - 2025-02-04 | Do this mean my product is ready to sell on FBA?
  - 2025-02-04 | 
  - 2025-02-04 | <@536075832658231299> I have 197 Units shipped to 6 Amazon locations. One shipment arrived and is in receiving. The other 5 shipments are 2- 3 weeks behind. Should I start selling the 50 units now or wait until they all arrive? I don't want the BSR to go down but I don't want to pay for storage either. What do you recommend?
  - 2024-12-19 | I still need to set up Mannychat and a watch the launch videos. Thanks for checking in!
  - 2024-12-19 | Hi Jaime. I'm doing well. My product is ready to ship but waiting on Amazon to approve one last thing before they will provide the warehouse shipping addresses. I've already reached out to Susan and about to pay for her assistance. Samples have been sent to Susan and to Vietnam. I'm working on reaching out to Friends and family to buy the product and leave reviews.
  - 2024-12-12 | and then switch to pro once my bulk order arrives at Amazon?
  - 2024-12-12 | Hello. I'm still on the amazon individual plan. Can I still keep this plan while I sell the FBM to friends and family and save on the additonal fees?
  - 2024-12-06 | Please remind me what I should put for the dangerous goods tab when I have batteries included üôè
  - 2024-12-06 | Ahhh ok thank you!
  - 2024-12-06 | And because it contains batteries, what should I put under dangerous goods tab?
  - 2024-12-06 | and then change it later to FBA?
  - 2024-12-06 | sorry I meant merchant fulfill
  - 2024-12-06 | On the listing creation - fulfillment type - do I put FBA initially to be able to send products to friends and for paid reviews?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Minh, Just schedule for Satruday at 4pm because it was available. If you need to change it, just let me know!
  - 2024-12-05 | Thank you! Should I delete the dummy listing now or leave it alone?
  - 2024-12-05 | I can just do a quick product listing creation to get the FNSKU and then go back and fine tune and make it better, is that correct?
  - 2024-12-05 | <@1059659092475531444> Can you please confirm if there's anything special I need to do to create the new listing under my brand? Or will it automatically go under the brand once the brand is approved and all I have to do is click on "Add product" at the top left corrner?
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Jamie. Thanks for checking in. I'm doing well. Juggling work and new baby and fam. My brand was just approved and I'm working on creating listing for the FNSKU to send to suppllier. My product is ready to ship. Feeling a bit overwhelmed since I'm reaching unknown territory right now.
  - 2024-10-28 | Hello! To get the FNKSU barcode, should I create the code using the sample listing I created before? Or create a new listing of the actual product I am selling then create the FNSKU?
  - 2024-10-23 | Can you please remind me I have one free session with Justin to go over the product selected, is that correct? Should I scheudle the call with him now? We are about to design packaing for this product and place bulk order when completed.
  - 2024-10-23 | Sorry their description wasn't clear. They said we don;t need packaging details until 8-12 months after application has been submitted.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is this the order I should be taking? Or do I need to go ahead and place the bulk order now to get the photos?
  - 2024-10-16 | I was waiting for the trademark to get approved first before I design the packaging to be send to the supplier and then order the builk order.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hi! I;m a little confused and just about to start the tradmark process. One of the attorneys list of itmes needed is a photo of our logo on the package. I thought this wasn't needed until we start the brand registry.
  - 2024-12-13 | Ahhhh ok. Thank you
  - 2024-12-13 | Same provider att. Just swapped out old modem
  - 2024-12-13 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> - We got a new modem recently - does that erase the old IP address? No one we know has been to our home and signed in our inernet since we got the new one. Inquiring for the reviews. Thanks!
  - 2024-12-10 | Hi <@1066465177140215928> 

I am ready for next steps! üòÄ Can you please let me know pricing and what you need from me to get started? Thank you
  - 2024-12-10 | Thanks Minh! The call was so helpful and definitely made me feel more comfortable and a clear way forward.  Thank you so much!

2. Working on PPC feedback provided by Susan
  - 2025-02-08 | 
  - 2025-02-08 | 
  - 2025-02-08 | 
  - 2025-02-08 | I understand what you said. A representative told me that in order to gain access to Premium A plus, at least 5 contents should be published. We have only 2.  That's what I am asking. What should I do to get 3 more published
  - 2025-02-08 | <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2025-02-08 | So, what should I do to get 3 more published?
  - 2025-02-08 | Mine are also approved. But only 2 are published. And they say I need to have 5 published.
  - 2025-02-08 | What can be the reasons of content getting approved but not published?
  - 2025-02-20 | 1% everyday
  - 2025-02-17 | 20 pushed up

  - 2025-02-11 | Yes. The person directed me to create a new discussion.  Anyways. I am contacting their representative via chat everyday now. Most of them say that my content is approved and its perfectly fine. And I should wait.
  - 2025-02-10 | <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2025-02-10 | She said a very new thing. Nobody has ever mentioned thay
  - 2025-02-10 | 
  - 2025-02-10 | I had a chat with a representative today
  - 2025-02-10 | No.
  - 2025-02-10 | 
  - 2025-02-09 | üëç
  - 2025-02-09 | Should I make another one?
  - 2025-02-09 | <@536075832658231299> the duplicate got published

  - 2025-02-08 | One at a time? And one for each Brand Story and EBC?
  - 2025-02-08 | In August or September
  - 2025-02-08 | Please be informed that all my Content is approved but only 2 are published . Is that a problem?

  - 2025-01-03 | I will ship them to Amazon after a plus content is solved out. Now I just sell FBM first.
  - 2025-01-03 | Goods are at my place
  - 2025-01-03 | Please check. Have granted you the permission
  - 2025-01-03 | I think that's image uploading

  - 2024-12-28 | Can this be a hurdle in getting premium account?
  - 2024-12-20 | What should be our next step?
  - 2025-02-14 | The session was amazing and full of learning. I struggle with the mechanism of PPC but I think now I am at a better learning. Especially,  I would like to highlight the point where he mentioned that "automation is good and crucial but you need to come up with your own strategies and ways too"

I look forward to have more session with people in the industry for several years. Their roller coaster is a road map for us. 

Also, it helped to get motivated again as he mentioned that his first launch was a learning experience for him. So is mine. IYKYK.

  - 2024-02-02 | Thank you brother. They are a big part of my "why"
  - 2024-02-02 | Hi Edward. I don't live in Philippines but the charity work I do is out there.
  - 2024-01-31 | 
  - 2024-01-31 | Hi All! Today is the last day of our official fundraiser. We didn't hit our goal, but we made some good progress. And I am super appreciative of the Shifu Family. Y'all donated half of what was raised, so super thank you to you all! And thank you to the Shifu's for allowing me this platform to share. Also,  I wanted to share the winners of a drawing contest I held for January. The kids' age ranged from 6-20 that participated. Here are the 1st and 2nd place winners in each age group. 1st place won 1000pesos = $18 and 2nd place won 300pesos= $5.50. Not huge prizes in regards to U.S. dollars, but in pesos, that's significant. These prizes were personally funded by me and doesn't come out of the donated funds from the GoFundMe fundraiser. I will continue to keep the fundraiser active should anyone else like to donate in the future, but I won't be soliciting on here anymore out of respect of other charity initiatives.  https://gofund.me/bca9ef76 . Thank you all!
  - 2024-01-27 | Here's a quick update on our tutoring hall. We are installing our railing leading to the tutoring hall today. It's the last piece of the facility to be installed. Thank you to those who donated. We still are hoping to hit our $5k by next month, but if not, we will still make things happen. The kids are worth it. Thank you for letting me share.
  - 2024-01-24 | Some of the kids that will be attending our tutoring hall wanted to say Thank You to our donors and future donors. You're making a huge difference.
  - 2024-01-22 | Here's a short video of our kids starting to use the hall for a drawing contest I've created for them. They are so excited to use the room and the supplies we have. Most of their classrooms are packed with 50+ kids in a room with no Air Conditioning. Right now we can only afford fans but that's fine for now. It will get warmer during the summer. We focus primarily on kids that can't afford to go to school or struggle to keep up with their lessons. The education system there tends to push kids into the next grade even if they aren't understanding well. This is why we have 7th graders here that still struggle to read or write. And parents are encouraged to teach their kids what their teachers don't, however, they don't know how to read or write themselves. So we hope this will be a beacon of hope for the kids in our village to have a proper education so they can have a chance to prosper.
  - 2024-01-22 | Quick update. Thanks everyone who has donated so far. We raised enough funds for a printer and paper! Here's my mom with our new printer. I'm very grateful to have her help since I run all purchases through her since she's there. We will now be able to print out handouts, enrollment forms, and other learning material for the kids. Thank you!
  - 2024-01-22 | 
  - 2024-01-22 | Thank you Shifu Family for donating to the charity work we are doing in the Philippines. Thank you to Susan Hang, Linh Doan, Joan Lovelle Alfeche, Davis Truong, Michael Lee and Phuong Nguyen for donating so far! You've gotten us even closer to our goal. Our fundraiser is still going until February, so if you'd still like to contribute, please visit our GoFundMe link. We now have enough funds to buy a printer and some school supplies, so your money is already being put to great use. üôÇ . https://gofund.me/bca9ef76

  - 2025-02-05 | When I joined I applied for Chase business ink, they had a $750 sign up bonus and no interest for 12 months! I've put everything on that card and have been paying only the minimum payment the last couple of months

  - 2025-02-03 | I'm not sure if the flow has changed but I don't see the "work on shipment". I did manage to find my individual shipments but it won't let me edit the dates.

  - 2025-01-17 | Hi team, I think I'm still slightly confused, this doc teaches you how to properly get FMB reviews but the part I need more help with is how to set up the FBM account for the page listing. I did a quick search in the modules but haven't seen a video on this. Can someone point me to the right place? Thank you very much! <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444> <@536075832658231299> <@1066465177140215928>

  - 2025-01-06 | Omg <@1230862203146473472> well deserved!! I know you've helped me so much. Excited to learn and grow with you
  - 2024-10-11 | Hannah Fan - omgitsdarkinhere
  - 2025-02-04 | Honestly, it's up to you! Macy does take a commission percentage off the top, but if you're ok with that and want to pay someone else to communicate with suppliers for you, you can do that. I reached out to them myself personally
  - 2025-02-04 | What happens if your bulk shipment arrives early? I'm tracking the boats they're on and it looks like it'll be a few days early. Should I change my shipping dates or does it not matter as long as they're not late?
  - 2025-01-28 | I'm seeing a listing fee and something else totalling around $16
  - 2025-01-28 | It's different but almost the same like $16ish
  - 2025-01-28 | Is it just me or does Amazon take about the same amount of fees from FBA as it does FBM?
  - 2025-01-23 | I believe Amazon will automatically try to replenish with existing stock. If you go through the modules it should explain the process to you
  - 2025-01-23 | I tried to negotiate a 5% discount for returns and they refused so I'm not sure how they would handle a 1 year warranty then
  - 2025-01-23 | It depends on your supplier. I asked what mine would do and they told me they'd send me free units on my next batch. I think it's probably faster customer service if you replaced it on your own with your inventory.
  - 2025-01-23 | Mine was 1 year but I'm not sure what the average is
  - 2025-01-17 | My shipping labels were also in Chinese, I think it's because you selected that it's shipping from China, it's so the Chinese workers know what it is and I think it's a great system Amazon has built

  - 2025-02-11 | I've set up keyword and sponsored products so far. <@536075832658231299> are you available tomorrow to review? I'm leaving for my honeymoon on Wed through the 25th
  - 2025-02-10 | no like my inventory page is active and has inventory, I'll be running ppc campaigns and the sponsors products campaigns in the next day or so after i clean up all my to-dos
  - 2025-02-10 | Hello team, I have officially launched! My some of my shipments have arrived earlier than expected and the rest are coming over the next few days. Any last minute things you think I need to focus on for launch? I am in the middle of getting a few videos made but it's taking longer than expected
  - 2025-01-23 | Oh no how does that even happen
  - 2025-01-23 | Also let me know if you are interested in doing FBM review for me! I would appreciate it üòåüôè‚ù§Ô∏è
  - 2025-01-23 | Let me know if you think there is anything else I need to prepare before my launch
  - 2025-01-23 | I'm starting to gather FBM review this week
  - 2025-01-23 | My bulk order should be arriving early Feb
  - 2025-01-23 | Hi team just wanted to update you on my status, I have my listing up and my listing images ready. My A+ needed to be resized so working on that. I've completed my keyword research and shoved my listing full of the highest searched and most relevant and also did competitor analysis
  - 2025-01-13 | Hi guys, figured this out. Thank you
  - 2025-01-13 | I'm guessing I ask my supplier who they are using since they're the ones shipping for me? Let me know
  - 2025-01-13 | What do I select here?
  - 2025-01-10 | if my supplier is shipping for me, do I select drop off? and for export license I select my own exporter?
  - 2025-01-10 | 
  - 2025-01-10 | I did have a question regarding shipping
  - 2025-01-10 | Yes they were so helpful!
  - 2025-01-09 | Hello all, I have a question. My supplier is asking for shipping mark for my bulk order cartons, what should I tell her? Like company name, product name?
  - 2025-01-07 | Do suppliers normally charge more for this label sticker?
  - 2025-01-07 | Yes the new listing in under my brand name! When I click on print item labels there is an error. So maybe I need to wait until tomorrow? I had some errors with my listing so I fixed that today as well
  - 2025-01-06 | <@536075832658231299> I did have the syllabus link but it looks like it's not open for me anymore.
  - 2025-01-06 | Got it. Yes I'll need to submit the battery exemption. I'll do that tonight as well. <@1054411267340763216> are you available tomorrow to help me with my shipping labels? It was in module 4 so I didn't get to it until it was too late. My bulk order is all packed and ready and I haven't supplied my supplier with my package labels or shipping labels üò≠
  - 2025-01-06 | This module it wasn't very clear how to do this step- https://shifuacademy.com/products/0f9531b5-a940-4ae1-a7a3-82195b7d9297/categories/2cfc128f-c767-4073-a3f2-a8767f49326b/posts/26dab8bc-acd8-45a8-9450-133152ae7d32

  - 2025-01-06 | Ok I'll do research on cheaper cpc keywords and select the category that best fits. Thank you guys. I didn't know Amazon recategorizes after a while. I just saw this locked symbol and my product can fit in many categories so I thought I'd ask! Thanks for your input everyone
  - 2025-01-06 | Got it, thank you!
  - 2025-01-06 | Got it, Justin suggested picking the category with the lowest CPC, how would you research that?
  - 2025-01-05 | Hi team, I'm creating my brand listing and i wanted to know if you know a way to research which industry is larger and more widely searched? My product is very versatile and could fall under many categories like PC, Camping, Home, etc. So was wondering if you know a way to research which industry is fastest growing and biggest on Amazon?
  - 2024-12-28 | Can I have some assistance on this?
  - 2024-12-28 | Hi team, I got a rejection for my brand registration
  - 2024-12-17 | Thanks for checking in!

  - 2024-12-05 | And if so, how much is reasonable to pay?
  - 2024-12-05 | If we have addon items to our product and we ship the addon items to the main product factory, I have to ask my supplier to add them into all the product orders and boxes, do I have to pay them extra for this extra work?

  - 2024-11-21 | 
  - 2024-11-21 | Hi team, do we pay taxes on our orders from china? I googled it and it says we need a resale exemption? And we‚Äôll typically need to provide Alibaba with a valid resale certificate. How do we get one?

  - 2024-11-19 | Hello team, my supplier is asking for Amazon warehouse address but I don't know how to find that, where can I find the warehouse address?

  - 2024-10-21 | Does this mean I have to continue product research?
  - 2024-10-21 | Can I ask why car electronic is not allowed?
  - 2024-10-21 | Are you not able to see the product and the link from air table? It asks us to submit the product keyword and a link to the product when we submit the analysis. I assumed you knew what product it is
  - 2024-10-21 | It is car electronic
  - 2024-10-21 | What is car electric category?
  - 2024-10-21 | I'm guessing automotive/car
  - 2024-10-21 | How do I find what category it is in?
  - 2024-10-21 | Great thank you. What is the next step? Is it reaching out to suppliers? Do I start module 2?

  - 2025-02-03 | Let‚Äôs go, Julia. Looking forward to be in the journey with everyone.

  - 2025-02-01 | Looking forward to this journey with you, man. The future is full of possibilities!
  - 2025-02-01 | Nice to meet everyone over Discord.

My name is Phong Dang. I'm out here in the Seattle area. Currently, my work is in the restaurant, serving up the best damn chicken sandwiches at Chick-Fil-A.

The reason I started this program is to create an additional income and work toward financial freedom. I'm doing this for my new family. My wife and my 1st born arriving at the end of Feb. And for my mother. 
I want to be a great provider for them. Give them a lifestyle and experiences life has to offer. My goal in 1-2 years will be to establish and have the system down that creates Passion income of $5k-$10k/month. Something I‚Äôd tell my future self, ‚ÄúSee, told you, you could do it. I'm proud of you.‚Äù 
When I face challenges, I‚Äôd tell myself ‚ÄúIt's all part of the process. Keep going. You're growing.‚Äù


I look forward to this journey with everyone.

  - 2025-02-15 | Weekly Plan for Amazon Business

A. Reflection  
Of the goals I set last week, I made some progress, but there were a few delays and distractions that slowed me down. I advanced in watching the module videos. 

This Week's Goals
1. Continue Watching Module Videos While Waiting for Product Information from Macy:  
   - Action Steps:  
     - Dedicate uninterrupted time daily to watch and take notes from the module videos.  
     - Use the waiting period to deepen understanding of Manychat.

2. Create a Social Page for the Business:  
   - Action Steps:  
     - Set up the page with a company information and cover photo.  
     - Prepare and schedule a few introductory posts to build your brand presence.

3. Setup Bank Account for Amazon Business:  
   - Action Steps:  
     - Gather necessary documents (e.g., business registration, identification) for chase bank account setup
     - Initiate the application process and also apply for credit card.
  - 2025-02-02 | Weekly Plan

A. Reflection
Of the goals I set last week, I made lots of progress but didn't fully achieve everything. Will carry over the incomplete tasks into this week's plan while adding new priorities.  

- Last Week's Goals and Progress:
  1. Finalize Supplier Research and Take Action ‚Äî Shortlisted five suppliers and requested information from three, but still waiting for responses from some. Need to follow up and assess sample quality.  
  2. Create dummy listing - created the dummy listing but some information were missing which did not let me submit it successfully. Gathering more information from suppliers to create a proper listing. 

- Main Roadblocks/Distractions:  
  1. Delays in supplier responses due to holiday in China. 
  2. Struggled with supplier's product selection and choosing the right product from different catalogue.  

- Solutions/Actions to Reduce Roadblocks:
  1. Set a deadline for choosing a supplier based on available responses instead of waiting indefinitely.  
  2. Create a structured daily schedule with dedicated time blocks for key business activities.  

B. Next Week's Goals

1. Finalize Supplier and Order Samples**  
   - Follow up with suppliers who haven't responded.  
   - Compare catalogue products to inquire more information about pricing, quality, and features.  
   - Select one or two suppliers to move forward with and request for samples.  

2. Refine Time Management and Continue Atomic Habits  
   - Set dedicated focus hours for supplier research, branding, and learning.
  - 2025-02-01 | So sorry to hear about your accident.üò¢  Glad you and everybody is safe. That is what is important. üôè
  - 2025-01-30 | 1. Re-watching sourcing module.
2. Reach out to suppliers in Alibaba.

  - 2025-02-10 | Have been traveling this weekend for my birthday but made sure to fit in pushups every day
  - 2025-02-03 | I think I got a bit too comfortable with just checking bid prices and nothing past that. Especially with holiday festivities, my mind was elsewhere.

I was being too passive in my approach and after our call at the beginning of the year, I wanted to start taking a more active position. 

Outside of cutting off and managing bleeders, I looked deeper into where my spend was actually going and noticed that my ASINs were overspending by a significant amount compared to my other campaigns. I looked through every ASIN on amazon and found that 10 out of my 15 original ASIN targets were actually not actively selling on amazon -- but the campaign was still spending money on them. My ACOS was already starting to improve just by managing bleeders, but after turning off the inactive ASINS, I started seeing my ACOS % drop significantly.
  - 2025-02-03 | I wanted to share a win with everyone. Over the last 3 weeks I've been locking in on optimizing my campaigns and I've been able to reduce my ACOS from a crazy 414% down to 91%. I'm excited to see continual improvement with some of my campaigns having single digit % ACOS.

Next target will be to get it under 50%! üöÄ
  - 2025-01-07 | Congrats!!
  - 2024-11-18 | Hey brother, just submitted the homework!
  - 2024-11-08 | Hey brother, thanks for checking in, I will have it submitted this weekend!

I‚Äôm Gia Kieu. I‚Äôm from Atlanta, GA. I‚Äôm currently an interior architecture student who is graduating in May. Now I‚Äôm doing nail for a living and leverage my saving. 
I love design and architecture but the profession is underpaying and requires overworking so mentally, I don‚Äôt think I can be a full-time designer for the rest of my life. 
My vision for the next 2 years is to run a successful Amazon business and earn 6K a month with Amazon along with being a part-time designer 
My goals in this journey is to:
- Have my own business and learn how to run one successfully
- Earn good passive income 
- Provide for my family, especially my parents
- Spend more quality time with my family
- Build good habits and network with people who have the same mindset

I‚Äôm looking forward to receiving mentorship and learn from each of you guys. This journey is my new hope for the next stage of my life. Thank you so much for welcoming me!

Here is my intro video:

  - 2024-09-26 | Help Vietnam‚Äôs Storm Yagi Victims:
Let‚Äôs Do More Together!

What Happened?
Storm Yagi hit Vietnam with devastating force, leaving entire communities in ruins. Heavy rains and winds displaced thousands, flooding homes and destroying vital infrastructure. Many families are now left without shelter, food, or access to medical care. The destruction is widespread, with entire villages submerged under water and roads washed away. The storm has created a humanitarian crisis, and immediate relief is critical to help these communities rebuild and recover. Your support can bring hope to those affected by this disaster.

How Can We Help?


Dear AMZ Shifu family,

We‚Äôve already donated $4,000 to aid the victims of Storm Yagi in Vietnam, but the need is still overwhelming. Thousands of families have lost their homes and are in urgent need of support. We‚Äôre now reaching out to our incredible community to join us in making a bigger difference.

Even a small contribution can go a long way in providing food, shelter, and medical aid. Let‚Äôs stand together to help those in need.

Please donate today: https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/PW6NVEZZ2H3SN
Organization: https://www.khbetterfuture.org/

Thank you for your kindness and generosity!
With gratitude,

Justin & Charlie

  - 2024-01-16 | Hi everyone

@Christopher Villanueva  is trying to raise funds to finish equipping his new tutoring hall he has created in the Philippines to help all the kids in that small village. He has listed items on the fundraiser that we need to still purchase to begin enrollment in February, so we are hoping to receive all funds before then.

Also, any person donating $500 or more will be considered a founding sponsor and will have their name placed on a permanent plaque on the building.

I think this is a good time to give back, to help more and more people and a fresh start for 2024. For any additional information, feel free to ask here or send Christopher a message.

You‚Äôll need to create your shipping label with Amazon first. They will automatically determine the addresses and split your shipment into five separate ones. By doing it this way, you‚Äôll save a significant amount on shipping costs when purchasing your amazon shipping label.

Once you‚Äôve generated the labels, you can send them to your supplier to confirm the shipping cost.

  - 2025-01-14 | Hi <@1292032925964959755> 

a 39% profit margin is solid! Great job finding a supplier that offered you such a good price. I‚Äôm really happy to see your progress. 
Go ahead and move forward with the next steps‚Äîordering your sample and continuing communication with your supplier. 

Go hard or go home! üí™
  - 2025-01-13 | I‚Äôm so glad to know that you‚Äôve made your final decision <@1292032925964959755> 

You can finalize your profit calculation sheet and I will help reviewing it before getting into the next step sis
  - 2025-01-05 | Hi <@1292032925964959755> ,

Please ensure that the product remains within the Large & Standard Size category, even when accounting for product add-ons, as this might make the package slightly larger than the original.

Additionally, aim for a profit margin of at least 30%.

Take your time with the process‚Äîthere‚Äôs no need to rush. If the current product doesn‚Äôt meet these goals, keep exploring. There are plenty of great opportunities out there waiting for you!

Let me know if you need further guidance.
  - 2025-01-05 | thank you
  - 2025-01-05 | Hi <@1292032925964959755> 

Please watch this recording and let me know if you have any questions

  - 2025-01-03 | Can you provide me the link of your product please ? 
I will make a loom recording helping you analyze the product before giving you my answer
  - 2025-01-03 | Hi Alice 

Thank you for updating 

As I mentioned on our 1 on 1 call, we don‚Äôt suggest going after the large bulky product, also if your margin is lower than 30% then it will be a high risk product 

I‚Äôm glad that you finally made a decision for yourself
  - 2024-12-27 | Hi Alice,

I recommend writing down a pros and cons list for your decision. Keep in mind that large and bulky items will cost more to ship, so ensure your margins are still good. Also, make sure you have enough space at home to store any returned packages.

Additionally, analyze the market one more time to confirm which size is generating more customer purchases. This can help guide your decision.
  - 2024-12-21 | Hi Alice,

There‚Äôs another option available for you, which is enrolling in the Brand Registry. However, please note that this option will require both time and money.

Alternatively, here‚Äôs a practical step you can take:

1. Communicate with your supplier and request their help in creating a final sample with the logo on it.
2.Once the sample is ready, they can take a picture and send it to you for brand approval.

Since you're ordering 500 units, I‚Äôm confident your supplier will be willing to assist you with this step.

As mentioned in the tutorial, it‚Äôs important to involve your supplier at this stage to make the process smoother.

Let me know how it goes!
  - 2024-12-17 | We just recently updated this new tutorial regarding brand registration 

Most of the members followed the old process in the past couple months so they suggested you to do the same thing. But please follow the Vault as your guidance

The brand approval is better and can save you both time & money <@1292032925964959755>
  - 2024-12-17 | You can start module 3, and work on your Many Chat after you done placing your bulk order <@1292032925964959755>

  - 2024-12-17 | Hi Alice,
I just wanted to remind you to take it easy and not overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôre doing great, and it‚Äôs okay to take a step back and breathe when you need to. Take things one at a time‚Äîyou've got this!

  - 2025-01-07 | Submit your Battery exemption first, it will be available
  - 2025-01-07 | also, did you create a new listing under your brand name ?
  - 2025-01-07 | Here is where to get your fnsku
  - 2025-01-07 | We have transferred everything from the Syllabus to the Vault so you can double check Shifu Vault <@505081578247159830> 

The tutorial for battery exemption is in module #1

Note : Even your product doesn‚Äôt contain any chemical you still need to submit both battery and chemical to get approved
  - 2024-12-28 | Please send all of your documents to my dm <@505081578247159830> I will help you review it
  - 2024-11-19 | Tell them you will provide the address whenever they are done with the production 

You will need the shipping boxes dimensions to create shipping labels
  - 2024-10-29 | Hi <@505081578247159830> usually you will need to wait a couple hours so the UPC you've purchased will be verified in Amazon system, let me know if you still have the same issue in the next 3 hours
  - 2024-10-21 | Great job on this one <@505081578247159830> , yes please continue on your product research
  - 2024-10-21 | I saw the link Hannah 
It's a Wireless Car stereo-compatible

We don't recommend this market :
1. This category has a high return rate compared with other category
2. This category is very competitive, new sellers are trying to undercut pricing, and you also will get attacks from CN sellers
3. We experienced a higher rate of having Hijacker in this category

  - 2024-10-21 | let me know if you have any questions
Again, confirm with me whenever you are done with your profit calculation sheet, we need to make sure it's more than 30% üòä
  - 2024-10-21 | Thank you sis <@505081578247159830> just want to make sure it's not in the Car-Electric category

Good job on this one, you can start on module #2
1. Create a dummy listing for this product
2. Practice communicating with your supplier
3. Work on your profit calculation sheet: make sure it's more than 30%
  - 2024-10-21 | Can you please tell me the category of this product first before we process to the next step ?

What issue are you having brother ?
  - 2025-01-03 | Background image:

As realistic as possible, and just keep it simple 

here is an example
  - 2025-01-03 | 1. Submit Another Image: Avoid using an image with a white background. Request your supplier's assistance to take a photo that as realistic as possible

2. Trademark Serial Number: It looks like the serial number isn't included in your document. Double-check your trademark registration papers or contact the trademark office to confirm and retrieve the correct number.
  - 2025-01-03 | Can I also have the trademark certificate and the contract with your supplier ?

Stop looking at the Canada Amazon, and start working on the US amazon
  - 2025-01-02 | I think that makes sense 

You need to do product research in US amazon because we are trying to sell in US market
  - 2025-01-02 | Did you scroll all the way to the left, make sure you didn‚Äôt miss any columns
  - 2025-01-02 | Go To customize -> make sure you turn on Seller country
  - 2025-01-02 | 
  - 2025-01-02 | many of our members did that without any problems
  - 2025-01-02 | You can , but it will be a long process with all of the legal documents to create a US account 

You still can sell in US market with a Canada account
  - 2025-01-02 | Where you located brother ? Are you living in the US or Canada ?

  - 2024-12-11 | 1. Everything in life is happening FOR you NOT to you. All the "negative" experiences you're life was meant as a learning experience and how you can grow from it. 

2. If you're in head, you're deadüíÄ your negative thoughts are just your thoughts and no one else's. When you are in your thoughts, they are all assumptions and not facts. Example: "Im never going to find a winning productüò≠ ". You will find that winning product if you have determination and focus. 

3. Problems need energy to live. If you feed energy to a problem, it would continue to exist. If you don't, then the problem magically disappearsüôÉ

  - 2024-12-11 | Hi Minh & Han, I have too much going on in my personal life that I don‚Äôt think I can find time to dedicate to this program anymore unfortunately. I know it sounds silly, but I want to withdraw from the program and focus more on what I‚Äôm currently doing (real estate) and get really good at that before I try something else (this). Maybe I‚Äôll come back to this later, maybe not. But as of right now, I need to be honest with myself and focus on one thing.
  - 2024-12-05 | Hi Anh Minh! Will do. I thought that training was on Fridays.

  - 2025-02-15 | It's SAT REFLECTION AND PLANNING, and you know what they say: "WINNERS ARE GREAT PLANNERS"


Check in here to let us know how close you were to the goals you set at the beginning of this week to receive accountability coaching/support to move the needle forward in your business. REMEMBER, you don't have to be perfect or hit all your goals week to week.  As long as you are 1% more than the week before, that's what matters This journey is a marathon, not a sprint! 

[do this each week] Answer the questions below:

A. Reflection: 
Are you able to hit the goals that you have set from the beginning of the week?

-If you have -> I want you to reward yourself with a treat (either eating at your fav restaurant or watching your fav movie) 

If you haven't -> I want you to still reward yourself with 50 squats /pushups, though, remember, at least you paid up and know that you can restart and get rid of the sense of guilt inside.

Reflect on what are the MAIN roadblocks/distractions from the previous week that you were facing. ( BE HONEST; WE ARE FAMILY. 

Share it and receive suggestions from those who have solved it)

What are the two possible solutions/actions that you will take to reduce/remove/replace these roadblocks or distractions so you can move closer to your goal?

-Share your MAIN WHYS to remind yourself of why you are on this journey. 

B.Planning next week's goal: 
What stage are you on this journey?

-What are your three main goals to focus on that will move the needle forward (the 20% that generate 80% results) ?

What support processes do you need to make that happen?

Post below so we can follow up with you and help you move forward. If you don't post below, it will be hard for all of our coaches and support to check in with you. so do me a favor POST ‚ù§Ô∏è @everyone

Check in here to let us know how close you were to the goals you set at the beginning of this week to receive accountability coaching/support to move the needle forward in your business. REMEMBER, you don't have to be perfect or hit all your goals week to week.  As long as you are 1% more than the week before, that's what matters This journey is a marathon, not a sprint! 

[do this each week] Answer the questions below:

A. Reflection: 
Are you able to hit the goals that you have set from the beginning of the week?

-If you have -> I want you to reward yourself with a treat (either eating at your fav restaurant or watching your fav movie) 

If you haven't -> I want you to still reward yourself with 50 squats /pushups, though, remember, at least you paid up and know that you can restart and get rid of the sense of guilt inside.

Reflect on what are the MAIN roadblocks/distractions from the previous week that you were facing. ( BE HONEST; WE ARE FAMILY. 

Share it and receive suggestions from those who have solved it)

What are the two possible solutions/actions that you will take to reduce/remove/replace these roadblocks or distractions so you can move closer to your goal?

-Share your MAIN WHYS to remind yourself of why you are on this journey. 

B.Planning next week's goal: 
What stage are you on this journey?

-What are your three main goals to focus on that will move the needle forward (the 20% that generate 80% results) ?

What support processes do you need to make that happen?

  - 2025-01-23 | 12 rules for Founders to live happily and successfully! 

1. You will always have problems. Learn to enjoy life while solving them.  

2. People don‚Äôt decide their future; they decide their habits, and their habits decide their future.  

3. In life, you can only control two things: your effort and your attitude.  

4. Don‚Äôt ask how to start. Start, and then ask how to improve.  

5. Happiness has less to do with pleasure and more to do with purpose.  

6. Life is harder when you expect too much from the world and too little from yourself.  

7. Life gets easier when you expect a lot from yourself and little from the world. High standards, low expectations.  

8. Half of your problems are simply your mind turning minor issues into major ones.  

9. Don‚Äôt look for secrets when what you need is repetition.  

10. Don‚Äôt let yourself be controlled by three things: people, money, or past experiences.  

11. In every challenge or even tragedy, there‚Äôs an opportunity. If you train yourself to find the opportunity, you can take control of the situation and even turn it into something positive‚Äîor, if it cannot be entirely good, at least something good can come from it.  

12. Be thankful every day, because even if you feel there‚Äôs nothing to be grateful for, your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù day is someone else‚Äôs dream.

  - 2025-01-16 | I once heard about a boy who loved climbing trees. He wasn‚Äôt the best at it, though. Every time he tried, he‚Äôd slip, scrape his knees, and sulk at the base of the tree, feeling like a failure. One day, an old man passing by stopped and asked, ‚ÄúWhy do you keep giving up, boy?‚Äù

The boy frowned and said, ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs too hard. Every time I try, I fall.‚Äù

The old man chuckled. ‚ÄúWhen I was your age, I couldn‚Äôt climb trees either. I fell so many times I stopped counting. But you know what I learned?‚Äù

The boy looked up, curious.

‚ÄúI learned that the moment I wanted to quit was always the moment just before I got better. You‚Äôre not failing‚Äîyou‚Äôre training.‚Äù

The boy scratched his head. ‚ÄúBut what if I fall again?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you get back up. Giving up doesn‚Äôt protect you from falling. It just guarantees you‚Äôll never reach the top.‚Äù

The boy stared at the tree. The branches seemed to whisper encouragement. This time, when he climbed, he didn‚Äôt care about falling. He focused on one branch at a time, higher and higher.

Eventually, he made it to the top. And from up there, he saw something he‚Äôd never noticed before‚Äîthe view was worth every scrape.

Giving up is easy because it feels like safety. But just like the boy, every time you feel like quitting, remind yourself: you‚Äôre not failing‚Äîyou‚Äôre training. The next branch might be the one that changes everything. Don‚Äôt give up on yourself. Keep climbing.

  - 2025-01-07 | Stay Disciplined  üí™üí°
1. Eliminate Comfort Zones - Force yourself into challenging situations to grow. Avoid excuses or environments that enable laziness.

2. Cut Off Distractions Completely - Disconnect from what is unnecessary for you, avoid non-productive activities‚Äîeven if it feels extreme.

3. Create Unbreakable Rules - Set strict boundaries for yourself and follow them without compromise, no matter how uncomfortable it gets.

4. Wake Up Early Every Day - Set an early alarm and get up immediately, even if you‚Äôre tired. Use the extra time for productive tasks.

5. Punish Laziness - Impose consequences for failing to stick to your goals, such as donating money, skipping leisure activities, or fasting.

6. Say No Relentlessly - Deny any request or activity that doesn‚Äôt align with your priorities, even if it offends or disappoints others.

7. Work Through Discomfort - Push yourself to complete tasks, even when you‚Äôre tired, unmotivated, or facing setbacks.

8. Limit Socializing With The Wrong People  - Reduce interactions with people who don‚Äôt support your goals, even if it means distancing yourself from friends or family.

9. Track and Confront Failures - keep a record of every missed deadline or failure and review it regularly to remind yourself of the consequences of slacking.

10. Avoid Overindulgence - deny yourself unnecessary pleasures, such as excessive food, entertainment, or luxury, to maintain focus and discipline.

... Just Keep Trying....

Discipline often requires tough love‚Äîembrace the struggle to reap the rewards.
  - 2025-01-07 | When you‚Äôre 25, 27, or 30, life will hit you hard.

You‚Äôll finally understand the saying, ‚ÄúMoney doesn‚Äôt grow on trees.‚Äù You‚Äôll work, pay for the house and bills, then work again‚Äîon repeat.

You‚Äôll miss your younger self, with fewer responsibilities and less knowledge about the harsh realities of the world.

There will be nights when you count the few hours of sleep you can afford. You‚Äôll wake up to work for money, searching for side hustles to earn even more.

The reality is, as you grow older, the burden you carry becomes heavier.

At 25, 27, or 30, you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôre no longer chasing just your own dreams. You‚Äôre striving to give your loved ones the best life has to offer.

  - 2024-12-26 | Listen up, Men!

Every morning, ask yourself: Am I better than yesterday? Did I progress, fail, or learn? These questions are your blueprint for growth.

Your only competition is the man in the mirror. Forget comparing yourself to others‚Äîit‚Äôs a distraction. The real battle is within.

Push yourself daily. Are you stronger, sharper, and closer to your goals than before? When failure happens (and it will), learn from it. Winners adapt, grow, and come back stronger.

Progress isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about consistency. Small, steady improvements add up to massive gains.

Take responsibility. No one‚Äôs coming to save you. If you‚Äôre not happy, take action.

Outdo the man you were yesterday. That‚Äôs the path to success and self-respect. Stay sharp, stay hungry, and never settle.

like how we cannot live without air 

how our words can either make or break someone's spirit or life 

How the world is connected with wifi

how entire world is the galaxy where there's no string holding its.

What powerful often can't be seen by eyes yet we all dwell into materialism and forget that God does exist

He can't be seen but he‚Äôs there for you and me.

  - 2024-12-19 | When Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, two of the world‚Äôs most successful individuals, are asked what single trait they attribute to their extraordinary success. 

Without hesitation, they both respond with one powerful word: focus. 

It‚Äôs all about the ability to concentrate on a single goal or task and give it your full attention. 

This focus has been a crucial driver behind their remarkable achievements.

Here are three tips to help improve focus 

1.Minimize Distractions: Create a quiet, clutter-free workspace and turn off notifications on your devices.

2.Set Specific Goals: Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps and set clear, achievable goals for each session.

3.Practice Mindfulness: Engage in mindfulness or meditation exercises to train your brain to stay present and focused.

  - 2024-12-13 | Another Travel tips for @everyone  this holiday when check in hotel.I always love Hyatt, have an account with them when booking. 

1. Always be nice smile, ask how the checkin agent days. It takes practice to be genuine and flow.

2. Ask if there's any complimentary upgrade available while sliding a $20-100 with a smile to take care of them. Have small little chat.

$20 you get complimentary extra services

$100: you may get suite upgrade 

->Got 3 days passs-  $45/person/day x2 person x 3 days bc i did the above. They sold out on suites
-> good investment win-win. Everyone happy 
<@1224111899873120308> since you requested it brother
  - 2024-12-13 | I agreed ü•≤. Not Dfw for SW lol
  - 2024-12-12 | I should work . But SW carries out in Dallas love field. Not DFW
  - 2024-12-12 | Lounge hack for Amazon digital nomads:

#senerios: i traveled from DFW -SFO to pick my mom up.
(Note: this work all airport in america with SE carrier)
She didn't landed until 8pm and I have already at the SFO.

Problem: I need food and a lounge work yet I don't have a next flight in order to have a boarding past to check in the lounge with my priority pass from Amex.

Solution: I booked a one way , same day 3-4 hours ahead flight from SFO - LAS with 

-Southwest (they are pretty easy on 24h cancellation no charge )

-once I checked in the lounge, I cancellled the flight.

Notes: do this at moderate frequencies. Don't overdo I would recommend 1-3 time max a year to avoid being terminated. 

Happy travel with your loved ones , Amazon warriors , for your holidays

As we celebrate this season of joy and togetherness, I hope you take time to relax, reflect, and celebrate how far you‚Äôve come. May your holidays be filled with love, laughter, and cherished moments with your loved ones.

Looking ahead, I can‚Äôt wait to see what we‚Äôll accomplish together in the new year. Remember, success isn‚Äôt just about reaching the destination‚Äîit‚Äôs about the journey and the lives we touch along the way.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
Wishing you and your family a season full of blessings,

  - 2025-01-14 | 1 No, you do not need to pay a renewal fee every year for an EIN (Employer Identification Number) as it is free to obtain and does not require annual renewal; however, most states do require LLCs to file an annual report and pay a corresponding fee to maintain their legal status, which is essentially a renewal process at the state level

2. I suggest getting professional support regarding maintaining or even starting an LLC (for beginners) if you need to set up an LLC properly and avoid big issues later on with the government or IRS while aligning with the code of conduct. 

Use this service that I and my mentor personally use to set up our LLCs for businesses and asset protection  This company is the one that worked for rich dad, poor dad author Robert Kiyosaki. https://corporatedirect.com/resources/books/the-abcs-of-getting-out-of-debt/

To start: go and schedule Schedule a free 15-minute consultation with one of our Incorporating Specialists at https://corporatedirect.com/Schedule. 
Important note: to get $100 OFF your new LLC formation. Be sure to put my full name [ NHUT CAO] at the bottom of the scheduling form

  - 2025-02-16 | One of my lawyers. We found a tons yet only a few are ethical. and remember, not all lawyers are good, many of them will take advantage of you if you don't do your due diligence. Human are crooked and it's you need to be responsible to filter and test for the right people!

A good lawyer will give you a good run and you can save a lot of time!

  - 2025-01-18 | hey @everyone sorry for the delay i got quite a bit of notification and forget this one

1/For amazon accounting  here's a software that you can hook up directly to your amazon account https://www.a2xaccounting.com/pricing
2/Regarding a CPA, i would suggest find a local CPA so that you can visit them and learn about tax while doing it.
one of the habits i would always recommend is to interview 3 possible options and find one that fit your energy and make sure they have record doing taxes for ecomerce.

3. for local CPA in dallas or texas, i will check if my perosnal one have the bandwith , usually, if you do the accounting correctly (i suggest using the a2x, it should be fairly simple and straight forward that any CPa can do.

  - 2024-11-01 | Any Ideas? My sales have somewhat picked up, but not many! I‚Äôve have turned off keys words that haven‚Äôt been producing and the one that have, I have given the a higher bid. I was given advice to lower the price to find the sweet spot and in the progress to find more key words. What do y‚Äôall think? 

1. Still gathering reviews!
2. Catching bleeder but also trying to push a lil more
3. Amazon Vine in progress!?
  - 2024-11-01 | Thank you!
  - 2024-12-12 | I tried looking it up  and clicking it from our previous appointment, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work
  - 2024-12-12 | <@1066465177140215928> can I get the link for an appointment?
  - 2024-12-11 | 1) What are the things that we did well?- 

-During the beginning of my journey, I went from doing 50/50 reviews to 100% reviews from friends and family. 

-I also enlisted in Vine reviews and have gotten positive feedback from it.  

2)What could we have done better?

- I could have paid more attention to PPC on catching bleeders, but since I was trying to gather reviews, I was being aggressive with PPC and letting it ride to gain more sales. 

-I‚Äôm more cautious of PPC now. 
 
Where were the biggest challenges?- 

-After I resubmitted PPC Excel sheet to Han's PPC tool, I became more attentive toward PPC and watched for bleeders. I think I grasped the PPC ideology down. 

3)What have I been avoiding that needs attention? 

-I‚Äôve been so busy at work with my clients since it‚Äôs the holiday season, it‚Äôs been busy. I‚Äôm exhausted when I get home. Plus, not trying to give an excuse, I‚Äôm tired. I need to be more active in the community. Choe and Louis are the people I check in with at least 2 times a week. 

4) Am I closer to achieving my goals? Yes or No? 

-I don‚Äôt know about closer, but I‚Äôm moving towards that direction. 


What do you want to happen at the end of Q4?

- I want to break even in order to place the second batch order.


5) What do I want to happen at the end of the month? 

-I want to see positive numbers, instead of negative numbers.
  - 2024-12-10 | Got my first Vine review at 5*
  - 2024-12-10 | <@536075832658231299>  <@1066465177140215928> um, if I were to start a new campaign with broad, phrase, and exact, do I need to do another ultimate and auto? Or when I launch the new campaign, just turn off certain key words and lower the budget to allocate to newer campaigns?
  - 2024-12-10 | What are the things that we did well?- Um, I went from doing 50/50 review, to 100% review. 
What could we have done better?- Pay more attention to PPC, but my thought were let it ride and gain more sales. 
Where were the biggest challenges?- after re submitting PPC Excel sheet to Han's PPC tool, now gonna optimize around  Breakeven Acos or under. 
What have I been avoiding that needs attention? Watching the Mods
Am I closer to achieving my goals? Yes or No? No, but staying positive and inching forward
What do you want to happen at the end of Q4?- Breakeven in order to place batch 2
What do I want to happen at the end of the month? More sales and breakeven
  - 2024-12-09 | I also lowered the budget per campaign wondering if that was a smart move!!? I can raise it back again.   I guess my concerns are not trying to get negative again, looking to breakeven forthe next batch, and also, should I optimize once a week, or every 2 days?
  - 2024-12-09 | @Han I submitted into PPC assistance, please disregard this first submission. The second submissions is the correct one with the price of 44.99
  - 2024-12-09 | I also raised my price 4 dollars
  - 2024-12-09 | 
  - 2024-12-09 | I‚Äôve been letting it go in order to gain sales!
  - 2024-12-09 | Should I be optimizing every 2 days in order to control bleeders?
  - 2024-12-01 | <@1066465177140215928>! For ur journey, how long before u saw profit? I remember you said you spent about $50k plus before u you saw profit?
  - 2024-11-20 | Since the beginning of my journey, I‚Äôve been doing 50/50 custom FBM review. Should I switch to 100% review?
  - 2024-11-20 | I have a meeting with <@1066465177140215928> next week, so hopefully it will pick up.
  - 2024-11-20 | I understand, but PPC is bleeding.  I understand the focus on the first batch is to gain ranking and gather as much review as possibly, but my board camp is hitting hard. What should I do? I lowered it according to the cheatsheet <@536075832658231299> give me.
  - 2024-11-19 | <@1066465177140215928> since my market is constantly changing, should I adjust my price of my product to stay below break even or a little above break even Acos?  Also optimizing to stay below break even Acos?
  - 2024-11-13 | <@1054411267340763216> can you help me with my FBM purchase and review!? Please and Thank you!
  - 2024-11-06 | How much would you charge for a redo of 1 main image?
  - 2024-11-06 | <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-11-06 | Susan!
  - 2024-11-04 | Yeah
  - 2024-11-04 | 7:40
  - 2024-11-04 | I‚Äôm up

  - 2024-11-04 | Susan! We still having our meeting at 8?
  - 2024-10-29 | Let‚Äôs do this!
  - 2024-10-29 | I‚Äôll ask
  - 2024-10-29 | I‚Äôm considering dropping my price to generate more sales and optimizing
  - 2024-10-29 | Han! I'm still gathering review until now, but is there anything else I can do to improve sales?
  - 2024-10-29 | done and submitted!
  - 2024-10-28 | Okay! Should I use the data to generate other keywords?
  - 2024-10-23 | Hi Han! I reentered the update information onto my PPC tracker. Can you take a quick look at it together with the information I submitted in the PPC assistance tool to see if they look correct.
  - 2024-10-23 | 
  - 2024-10-22 | I‚Äôm on if you wanna join a lil early
  - 2024-10-21 | <@536075832658231299>  just to confirm our meeting tomorrow at 4?
  - 2024-10-21 | üëç
  - 2024-10-21 | I accidentally did it
  - 2024-10-17 | I don‚Äôt want to miss any opportunity?
  - 2024-10-17 | Since yesterday was the 14 mark, should I work with some of for the program to optimize the campaign according to Q4 bids?
  - 2024-10-15 | Do you have anything sooner?  Tomorrow is the 14 days mark, and the appointment I made is next week
  - 2024-10-15 | Han! I accidentally made  two appointments with you for next week. Just keep the one on Tuesday at 4.
  - 2024-10-15 | I assumed once I copy and paste the link, it would work automatically
  - 2024-10-15 | I got it!
  - 2024-10-15 | Ok!
  - 2024-10-15 | I was trying to look for it
  - 2024-10-15 | Susan! I remember you shared this file with Ngoc and me
  - 2024-10-15 | I have a meeting with Susan later today, I‚Äôll bring up all the questions I have with her. After, I‚Äôll schedule an appointment with you, Han, to go over optimization.
  - 2024-10-15 | I copied the link to the search engine, but it‚Äôs not letting me edit the ppc tracker page.

"Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

 In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

The world wants you to be typical ‚Äì in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don‚Äôt let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it‚Äôs worth it. The fairy tale version of ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don‚Äôt expect it to be easy or free. You‚Äôll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical ‚Äì to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that. "
  - 2025-01-27 | turned on my fbm this weekend and sold 8 units at 25% higher than my fba. one person ordered 4 units üôè  and a customer reached out to me on fb and etsy saying they wanted to order more but couldn't find my product.
  - 2025-01-24 | Omg would love to hear more about the details!
  - 2025-01-24 | thanks olesia, this was probably one of my toughest challenges on the amazon journey so far. it's no wonder justin is so hard on us. it never gets easier - only harder!
  - 2025-01-24 | never let your guard down guys!!
  - 2025-01-24 | thank you! the craziest thing to me is that this was my 8th batch. i have ordered 8500 units at this point. i still can't fathom how such a mistake was made. the downside is, i have no january sales. i missed out on 80k+ revenue.

  - 2025-02-21 | there's nothing you can do about it. but if you use it in your listing, you will have to think about how they can get the ebook. or you can just save the ebook idea for the next batch.

  - 2025-01-26 | as for how i negotiate for better pricing on each bulk order, there are a few things to consider 

1. your order has to be bigger than the previous order

2. if using a sourcing agent, simply ask along these lines (rephrase as fit)

given the increase in units on this order, my boss has asked if there's any way we can get better pricing?

if they push back, do the below üëá 

3. if negotiating with supplier directly, you need to paint the picture of growth. show how well/quickly your first batch sold out, how quickly you stole market share from competitors, explain that you need cash flow for growth and how the supplier will be a partner in that growth. if possible, mention % increase you're expecting to order on upcoming batches.
  - 2025-01-26 | hi all, here is the conversation showing how i negotiated for 30 day payment terms on a % of the goods and convinced them to cover 100% of the costs.

  - 2024-12-23 | i'm not sure what the "matched product" you're referring to is. i don't have this on my search term report. but basically you would want to identify the asins and negative the targets of those with high clicks and no sales. feel free to send screenshots in your private channel!
  - 2024-12-20 | Since this is a high-priority keyword, try lowering the bid further. A bid of $1.50‚Äì$2.00 might allow you to still show up for this keyword without spending too much. Monitor the clicks and sales at the lower bid.

<@536075832658231299> thoughts?
  - 2024-12-20 | 30 clicks I would negative but Han might be more lenient esp with holiday.

How much have you lowered bid at this point?

  - 2024-12-05 | <@1230862203146473472> can you share with the group how you were able to get access to premium a+ within 1-2 days after contacting amazon support? what did you do, which outlets did you contact and how quickly were you able to resolve it?
  - 2024-12-04 | what is it asking for
  - 2024-11-22 | Han might have some useful tips. In the past, I tried tracking the times of day when orders were placed‚Äîearly morning, mid-day, or evening‚Äîto see if there was a specific trend. The idea was to allocate more budget during peak times using Amazon PPC‚Äôs time scheduling feature. However, my product didn‚Äôt show a consistent trend, so I ended up not utilizing the time scheduling tool.
  - 2024-10-23 | that's fine. raise your price too <@1167106129415909496>
  - 2024-10-08 | i personally look at each campaign individually. if they are performing (i.e. making sales and meeting target acos or lower, i will increase. if it's just a bit above target acos, i would still increase). if they haven't performed at all, i will not increase.
  - 2024-10-11 | <@809813064756887582> post your info here so han can get you added to private channel
  - 2025-02-15 | just piggybacking on minh's response in case you're looking for more details.

when you ship to amazon, amazon will charge you placement fee. that placement fee is different whether you're shipping to 1 vs 3 vs 5 locations. usually the placement fee will be most expensive to 1 location and cheapest to 5 locations.

when you're getting shipping quotes, we usually recommend just picking one location closest to where you live just so you can have a frame of reference for calculating your margin.

after you place your bulk order, it's time to get real shipping quotes. you will first need to create the shipping plan in amazon, which will then give you the placement fees AND the exact warehouses to ship your goods to. 

you can give those warehouses to your supplier and other shipping agents to get an exact quote. yes, you can add them all up to see how they compare to the one location + placement fee scenario.
  - 2025-02-12 | I think this is ok since it doesn‚Äôt say get $ back after you review or shop on amazon
  - 2025-02-08 | Example: I want to sent a unit to an influencer. I will use MCF to fulfill. Or I made a sell on Etsy or Shopify or TikTok shop, I would use MCF to fulfill
  - 2025-02-08 | This is only if you are trying to send your product (from your Amazon inventory) to someone else
  - 2025-02-04 | Love Macy! Highly recommend!

  - 2025-01-21 | there's this section (i don't know if it lives in the same spot for every listing). this is showing up under "brand story" for me.

ask a question, click enter, then look for the "post your question" button
  - 2025-01-20 | you have to ask the people leaving fbm to ask the question. you can then answer it.
  - 2025-01-16 | you should also work on an inspection check list for when the bulk order is complete! make sure the third party inspector has a reference for what features and functions to test.

  - 2024-08-09 | This is correct!
  - 2024-08-08 | See ^ - higher means harder and more competitive to rank on. It's good if you are meeting those numbers, but as a new seller we need to balance using a good mix of higher and lower cpr words with a decent search volume.
  - 2024-08-08 | 
  - 2025-01-15 | And it might depend on if you‚Äôre SCorp or not.
  - 2025-01-15 | I think different states call it different things
  - 2025-01-15 | LLC may require you to renew or file some sort of annual report each year depending on your state. You can find this info by googling.

For example in NC, I have to file annual report every year before April
  - 2025-01-14 | Not ein but for LLC and if you have someone doing legal forms then yes
  - 2024-12-17 | also look on computer not on the app
  - 2024-12-17 | usually when that happens to me, i notice they put more into reserves
  - 2024-12-17 | check if your account level reserve changed
  - 2024-12-11 | Never know when it will be available or go into fc transfer again
  - 2024-12-11 | I wouldn‚Äôt even worry about just 1 piece left. Just close
  - 2024-12-02 | yes this is right
  - 2024-11-10 | Who left the review?
  - 2024-11-03 | 20% off your current selling price
  - 2024-11-03 | i believe it has to be 20% minimum discount from the lowest price you've been selling at. han correct me if i'm wrong.
  - 2024-11-03 | i usually just do the % off and then set minimum price but there's no wrong way
  - 2025-02-10 | it's been 2 days. i told her to leave it stranded for 20 days
  - 2025-02-10 | <@536075832658231299> does olivea have to set her removal settings to 30 days or is it automatic?
  - 2025-02-16 | <@536075832658231299> do you know if the duplication process for premium a+ has changed? i think david is having the same problems as hai.
  - 2025-01-08 | is your supplier shipping your goods <@387131636707360768>? make sure you factor the shipping rate into your margin and if you need/want a cheaper option, the team has shipping agents you can reach out to as well. 

some mentees choose to just go with their supplier because it's easier and less stressful on the first batch, but i recommend maximizing your margin!
  - 2024-11-18 | omg an, CONGRATS. my husband and i shot vietnamese american weddings for the longest time. got me feeling all nostalgic over here lol! can't imagine how exhausted you might be haha
  - 2024-10-10 | I usually go off cpc if I need to aggressively bring acos down, otherwise I go off the current bid

Your bid is the max you‚Äôre willing to pay
  - 2025-02-15 | it's in this screenshot
  - 2025-02-15 | click on "spyros" next to contact buyer
  - 2025-02-02 | You will def get a bad review from this. It‚Äôs only a matter of time
  - 2025-01-12 | in my experience it seems random as to when it happens. i think they might email you to let you know but i can't remember for sure. this is beyond our control though.
  - 2025-01-02 | d
  - 2025-01-02 | then you will get registered. so you still have anywhere from 4-6 months to be fully registere
  - 2025-01-02 | the NOA will confirm that USPTO has approved the mark for registration and then you will have to provide proof that your product is actually being sold
  - 2025-01-02 | you have 30 days for someone to dispute until it's official. still in the process but you're in the final stages. it will still take a while until you're officially registered.
  - 2024-12-19 | after you complete it, you can schedule your call with han to launch

  - 2025-02-09 | Just 14? I would fulfill myself or use for influencer marketing - or even keep as backup to fulfill defects in the future
  - 2025-01-30 | <@536075832658231299> phuong has a question about shipping - i'm not sure of.

1. shipment split to 5 warehouses. one of the warehouse has goods coming from UPS and FedEx. Does she need to enter both tracking?

my thoughts are no as long as they arrive within the same window since you can only enter one tracking.

2. there was one carton that's missing one unit. So they shipped that unit a week later and it's with UPS. is this ok?

i'm guessing amz will just scan it in once they get it.

<@1213271303327453305> did i miss anything here?
  - 2025-01-14 | I will DM you tomorrow! Just saw this!
  - 2024-10-21 | this can happen anytime. the market moves fast. speed of execution is key.
  - 2024-10-17 | I skipped package design on my first batch. It‚Äôs a nice touch but not worth risking if you‚Äôre required To have 1000 units. I did custom package on second batch.
  - 2024-10-16 | too risky. agree with minh üëÜ need proof of concept first
  - 2025-02-20 | how many days did you run the test?
  - 2025-01-07 | ask chuong at the mastermind. chuong def know
  - 2024-12-12 | <@1168356026471436323> what chuong is talking about han has covered and taught before. you have to do the daily visibility spreadsheet to find out cost of acquisition
  - 2025-02-13 | cost to manufacture the goods + shipping/unit for those goods
  - 2025-02-13 | yes
  - 2025-02-12 | Hmm I def didn‚Äôt connect a bank account.
  - 2025-02-11 | on your next batch, we can begin to optimize ppc for profit
  - 2025-02-11 | that's incredible that you were profitable on your first batch! i wasn't net positive until my third batch. capital is definitely going to be an ongoing problem. some ways i've been working through this:

- continue opening credit cards. my husband and i have 7 opened between the two of us ü§Ø 
- justin is a fan of asking friends & family for money and paying the loan with interest
- i have invested in whole life insurance and will be pulling capital to continue funding
- open a business line of credit with your local bank
- don't run out of stock anymore because your cash flow will be even more tight
- negotiate for better payment terms (try to ask your supplier not to final amount until after goods arrive to amazon OR 30 days after the goods arrive to amazon - usually you will need to be doing higher volume for this)
- find a partner. they will have to put $$$ up front for a % of ownership

<@536075832658231299> <@975774205658411068> <@705204493620478032> have way more experience in this.
  - 2025-02-09 | Yes call
  - 2025-02-08 | just ask to incrase sales limit and put that you're making like 150,000-200000/year
  - 2025-02-08 | you usually don't need to show proof
  - 2025-01-16 | the price after the coupon needs to be 47.49, so adjust the % of the coupon accordingly

  - 2024-10-11 | i know... i'm just thinking we at least want him to post it lol
  - 2024-10-11 | maybe something less snarky so he actually posts it? something along these lines... just a thought - maybe you can merge the two somehow or feel free to post your response üòÖ 

Thank you for sending over the video this morning. We truly appreciate your patience and understanding throughout the process, especially given the initial delay caused by the software update. While we had communicated our decision to part ways due to the extended timeline, we‚Äôd be happy to move forward with the first posting of the video and will no longer request the payment. We‚Äôre grateful for your effort and contribution, and we‚Äôd love to conclude our sponsorship on a positive note. Thank you again
  - 2024-10-11 | i'm thinking the same. he has 31k subscribers on youtube. i suggested taking the shitty video and not moving forward with second video
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont want him to make a video NOT recommending it or talking about how much it sucks
  - 2024-12-10 | no need to redo ultimate and auto.

you can either do new campaigns with new budget or turn off keywords and add new ones. if you're just testing new keywords, i would personally do new campaign but either way works here.
  - 2024-12-09 | 2 days too fast to optimize
  - 2024-12-02 | 50k was my bulk order for q1 earlier this year
  - 2024-12-02 | i don't think i spent 50k. it was more like 30k
  - 2024-12-02 | i made profit on my third batch
  - 2024-11-19 | because if you are and adding a 20% discount for the event then don't mess w/ your price till after the event
  - 2024-11-19 | are you participating in BF/CM?
  - 2024-11-04 | give me 5 mins. is that good for you?
  - 2024-11-04 | Well 9 est for me
  - 2024-11-04 | Yes
  - 2024-10-29 | you can drop price to see if it drives more sales. 

have you played with optimizing your listing images?
  - 2024-10-15 | you have to make a copy of the sheet tam (file > make a copy)
  - 2024-10-15 | this one?
  - 2024-10-15 | make a copy of it then you can edit
  - 2025-02-11 | okay, we don't consider "launching" until you turn on ppc. are you planning to do call with han to launch? i'm guessing you don't need help reviewing your ppc keywords
  - 2025-02-10 | by launched, you mean you turned on ppc?
  - 2025-01-30 | from this screen <@505081578247159830> you can click "edit window"
  - 2025-01-30 | 
  - 2025-01-09 | I see Louis and tim already responded!
  - 2025-01-06 | saw you just moved this here. 

han might have a more efficient method, but here's what i would do:

1. Create a dummy campaign (you don‚Äôt need to activate it).
Add keywords relevant to your category or add categories, and Amazon will suggest bid ranges and estimated CPCs based on competition.

2. Helium 10 (Cerebro)
Helps you find keywords with their estimated CPC and search volume.
Look for low-CPC, high-converting keywords in smaller niches.
This only helps for keywords not categories but you will get an idea of the category if you segment your keywords accordingly
  - 2025-01-28 | I like this idea for beginners but I‚Äôm not sure how limited it will make the product pool
  - 2025-01-06 | we can discuss as a team and work on something after the mastermind! maybe it gets covered during the mastermind <@536075832658231299>

  - 2024-12-09 | tam is in panick mode. he's reaching out to everyone. we've done one on one calls a few times already
  - 2025-02-12 | question for you... are you trying to use your dummy listing that got approved?
  - 2025-02-12 | from raniel: 

Hi Susan, I just want to describe my current situation right now and would really like to know your advice on this matter.  So the information I submitted from you is all from my bare-bone listing that went through and was not flagged at all by amazon. I know and have seen mentees and also competitor‚Äôs product online listing has been taken down due to red light therapy and use of laser. My question is my direct #1 competitor, I copied and pasted all their info on to my listing and plan on filling in other info with my own. That is where I got the fnsku which you used for my package design. At this point it‚Äôs a no brainer to use my bare listing as the main listing. So what I‚Äôm getting at is I tried to created another listing which was supposed to be the main listing draft and it got flagged. What would be your best advice? Just keep going with the bare-listing
  - 2025-01-18 | he sent me this yesterday
  - 2025-01-18 | <@1054411267340763216> is there an updated video for creating the barebones listing? Raniel is having issues

"So after barebone listing, should i create a contract with supplier and schedule a call with the instructors so i can place the bulk order?"

<@1054411267340763216> is thuy required to schedule a call before the bulk order?
  - 2024-11-14 | <@536075832658231299> did you know carolina is selling at 15% margin right now? she's 50% through her inventory, i was wondering if we should bring up her price?
  - 2024-10-14 | should be good
  - 2024-10-14 | make sure you sell some FBM at the 30% higher price
  - 2024-10-14 | ignore sale price bc you're not running a sale.

make list price 30% higher than your price

  - 2024-10-30 | no you shouldn't have to
  - 2024-10-15 | Amazon can hold payment for over 14 days, as an ‚Äúaccount level reserve.‚Äù This is something you agreed to, when you signed up.

The reserve amount is determined by various things. These include how long you‚Äôve had your account, returns, reviews, and if you have any unresolved disputes.

if everything is good, you will eventually be paid out for everything just takes some time at first
  - 2024-10-15 | <@1213335800205414452> sorry for the delay. reposting your ? here in case han can provide better explanation too

  - 2024-12-21 | I know this has been inconvenient but it happens. I‚Äôm sorry to say that there is no other solution at the moment.
  - 2024-12-21 | Not all Amazon reps are the same. Most of them are not very good at their job so you have to keep calling until you get the right person. For the mentees running into this issue, they have just kept calling until they got someone who can help.
  - 2024-12-21 | His advice was:

I called them twice, 1st time they said that‚Äôs nothing they can do, I have to wait and check every week.
And 2nd time I called, I asked if this is the right department to ask for premium A+, and then I explained that I already have brand registry and tried to access to premium, they told me to wait and started to process.

I think it just matter with some one we talk to‚Äù
  - 2024-12-21 | You need to keep calling
Thong Thai had the same problem and he followed the premium a+ steps after you did
  - 2025-01-07 | we figured it out han

  - 2025-01-10 | flight officially canceled, so i won't make it!
  - 2025-02-18 | when we thought she "launched", she didn't actually because she didn't have the buy box
  - 2025-02-18 | we didn't increase the bids bc turned out her campaigns had no impressions for a good 10 days
  - 2025-02-18 | you have other feedback?
  - 2025-02-18 | i have also advised her that to sell any beauty product you always need reviews (lots of social proof of people wearing the product both photos and videos)
  - 2025-02-18 | i think it's the broad keywords eating all the budget. should we turn those keywords off while she's working on optimizing the pricing?
  - 2025-02-18 | <@536075832658231299> 

from thuy: Can you please check my campaigns also ? I have 5 campaigns running each $40/day which will cost me $200/ day it‚Äôs quite a lot for me on top I got no sales so far . Thank you
  - 2025-02-15 | <@1225664394923348019> check to make sure your campaigns are running
  - 2025-02-15 | you have to make the discount bigger
  - 2025-02-13 | add coupon, go to advertisting > coupon > create new coupon for $20
  - 2025-02-13 | when you go to edit your price, make your LIST price 229

make YOUR price $189
  - 2025-02-12 | let's not change your bids yet. i think the problem was that you didn't have the buy box, which is why your ad impressions didn't do anything
  - 2025-02-12 | you need to implement the pricing we talked about, add your coupon
  - 2025-02-12 | <@1225664394923348019> you have the buy box now
  - 2025-02-11 | 
  - 2025-02-11 | <@536075832658231299> she doesn' thave the buy box
  - 2025-02-09 | all keywords/targets have no impressions
  - 2025-02-09 | today is superbowl so probably will be slow anyway but at least we can see for tomorrow
  - 2025-02-09 | do you think we should increase bids by 10% and see if anything happens?
  - 2025-02-09 | i thought her keywords have decent search volume on it
  - 2025-02-09 | <@536075832658231299> it's been 10 days and she still has no impressions on her campaigns

  - 2025-01-24 | <@1225664394923348019> can you confirm you went to the toolbar >  user permissions?

just asking because my screen on my personal seller central account doesn't look like yours
  - 2025-01-24 | only having this problem with thuy's account
  - 2025-01-24 | but even when i tried again hours after, it still gives me the same error
  - 2025-01-24 | 
  - 2025-01-24 | i got the invitation, but when i access it, this is what i get (happened with both emails)
  - 2025-01-24 | i tried 2 already
  - 2025-02-18 | i would not do this and just focus on your own ebook. otherwise, it's not really value-added
  - 2025-02-17 | also i don't know how big your competition is. if. you have very limited asins to target, maybe you can pick 1-2. if you have more asins like your product to choose from, focus on those if you have a better/stronger offer
  - 2025-02-17 | focus on the asins that you believe you can beat (i.e. win the sale on).

if you want to test one of these asins, maybe just pick one like it, don't like 5 like it.

  - 2025-02-17 | you need to add 15-25 asins

Thanks so much for coordinating the call with Bernard. Today‚Äôs session was super helpful. I really enjoyed depth of knowledge he shared on structuring and optimizing PPC campaigns. Up until now, I had no real insight into how other sellers or PPC experts organized their campaigns, so this session was pretty eye-opening.

I also appreciated how he reinforced some strategies from the program while also introducing new ideas that I hadn‚Äôt considered before. As I work through my relaunch, I‚Äôm excited to implement some new things.

If anyone missed out on this training, I‚Äôd definitely recommend watching. Feel free to pass along my feedback - I‚Äôd love to join more sessions like this in the future!

  - 2025-02-20 | thank you Shifu Han!
  - 2025-02-20 | So, this is the strategy from the guest speaker, right? I asked him whether I should relaunch using this approach or stick with my current setup, and he recommended revamping all of my existing campaigns and proven keywords. I always thought this strategy was only for newly launched products. I need to watch the video lesson again. üòÖ
  - 2025-02-20 | One way I get more FBM purchases and reviews is by giving away the product. I ask my friends to reach out to their own friends and family who would be interested in receiving the product for free in exchange for a review with images or a short video. Most of the time, they'll say yes to the offer.  Which PPC method did you use? Would you mind sharing it?
  - 2025-02-20 | This week, I only had one FBM sale with a friend's help, and all my other organic sales came from FBA. üòä
  - 2025-02-20 | Here‚Äôs my Wednesday check-in! My goals this week are to get 3 FBM sales, finish listing optimization, and lock in some influencer collaborations. So far, I‚Äôve gotten 1 FBM sale and still need 2 more. Listing optimization is still in progress, and I‚Äôve secured 2 influencer deals for UGC videos while working on 2 more. Some of my inventory is available on FBA now, but I haven‚Äôt fully relaunched since my listing images and details aren‚Äôt updated yet. On the bright side, I‚Äôve been getting 1‚Äì3 organic sales over the last few days! I‚Äôve also added a PPC revamp to my to-do list so I can be fully ready for the relaunch. My goal is to have everything done by Sunday!
  - 2025-02-17 | Thank you, Shifu!
  - 2025-02-17 | The stress in my life helps me grow because it pushes me to juggle my Amazon business, other work commitments, family responsibilities, and unexpecte d challenges like a recent freeway incident. I ran over a tire and thought it was stuck under my car, so I had to pull over. I was stranded far from home for over two hours, stressed and anxious, especially worrying about how I‚Äôd pick up my daughter. When the tow truck finally arrived, it turned out to be a simple fix. It was a reminder that things often feel worse than they really are, and staying calm under pressure is everything. But not all stress is worth holdign on to. I‚Äôm working on letting go of perfectionism and the habit of stresing over things I can‚Äôt control. I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs okay to ask for help and set boundaries. Now, I choose to let stress work for me, not against me. Every challenge is a chance to grow, and every setback has something to teach me. I don‚Äôt need everything to be perfect. I just need to keep moving forward and stay focused on my ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù

  - 2025-02-12 | Wednesday Check-In

Happy Wednesday, everyone!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This week, my focus is on securing 5 FBM purchases, writing detailed notes about the new product upgrades and key elements for upcoming influencer videos, and optimizign my listing. So far, I‚Äôve gotten 1 FBM purchase, with 2 more on the way, and I‚Äôve finished writing the detailed product upgrade notes. I‚Äôm still working on optimizing the listing and have now aded a shipping issue to my to-do list. One last carton was left behind in China while the rest of the inventory is already at the port, ready for delivery to Amazon.

On the bright side, I revamped my ManyChat flow to make it simpler for elderly customers, who make up at least 50% of my target market, and created a new warranty certificate to go with it. I also produced two social media content pieces and re-read The Blue Ocean Strategy. Next week, my focus will be on securing five FBM purchases (is this too risky?), writing detailed notes on my new product upgrade and key elements for influencer videos to ensure effective marketing, and sending these notes to influencers in advance so they know what to highlight when they receive the product.
  - 2025-02-06 | This is a good idea but it sound like we will need to give out a lot of product. üòÖ
  - 2025-02-06 | When I first launched, I had a similar offer, but I decided not to use Vine. Since my initial batch was still in the testing phase, I wasn't sure how customers would react to the product's quality and value. Using Vine at that stage was too risky because the chance of getting negative reviews was much higher, which could have hurt the product's reputation early on.
  - 2025-02-05 | So far, I‚Äôve had one FBM purchase this week, I‚Äôm halfway through creating my new warranty card, and I still need to work on new social media content. My agents are back in action, time to let them play detective and track down my missing carton!.
  - 2025-02-03 | This week, I plan to create a new warranty certificate for ManyChat, work on getting at least three FBM purchases, and create content for social media.
  - 2025-02-02 | LAST WEEK REFLECTION AND PLANNING

Last week, I wrote reviews for my listings so I‚Äôd have them ready when I need to send them to my FBM reviewer. I also created a video and some content to post on my product page. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I got much done for my Amazon business since it was Lunar New Year week, and I had other work priorities.

One of the cartons is missing in shipment. Hoping it gets resolved once my shipping agent is back this week.

For this week, I‚Äôll be reaching out to influencers to collaborate on new review videos and an instruction video for my upgraded 2025 product.
  - 2025-01-31 | How was the experience before the accident happened? You are brave! üòÑ

  - 2025-02-05 | So far, I‚Äôve had one FBM purchase this week, I‚Äôm halfway through creating my new warranty card, and I still need to work on new social media content. My agents are back in action, time to let them play detective and track down my missing carton!.
  - 2025-02-03 | This week, I plan to create a new warranty certificate for ManyChat, work on getting at least three FBM purchases, and create content for social media.
  - 2025-02-02 | LAST WEEK REFLECTION AND PLANNING

Last week, I wrote reviews for my listings so I‚Äôd have them ready when I need to send them to my FBM reviewer. I also created a video and some content to post on my product page. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I got much done for my Amazon business since it was Lunar New Year week, and I had other work priorities.

One of the cartons is missing in shipment. Hoping it gets resolved once my shipping agent is back this week.

For this week, I‚Äôll be reaching out to influencers to collaborate on new review videos and an instruction video for my upgraded 2025 product.

  - 2025-02-10 | This week, my main focus will be on securing five FBM purchases. I will also write detailed notes about the new product upgrade and key elements for influencer videos to ensure effective marketing. These notes will be sent to influencers in advance so they can highlight the right features when they receive the product. Additionally, I will dedicate time to optimizing my listing for better visibility and conversion.
  - 2025-02-09 | Saturday Reflection and Planning for the Week Ahead                                                                                                                                                                                    This week, I was only able to get one FBM purchase, so I‚Äôll put extra effort into getting more next week. On the bright side, I revamped my ManyChat flow to make it simpler for elderly customers, who make up at least 50% of my target market, and created a new warranty certificate to go with it. I also produced two social media content pieces and re-read The Blue Ocean Strategy. Next week, my focus will be on securing five FBM purchases (is this too risky?), writing detailed notes on my new product upgrade and key elements for influencer videos to ensure effective marketing, and sending these notes to influencers in advance so they know what to highlight when they receive the product.

  - 2025-02-20 | The 197 you see isn‚Äôt the number they received. it‚Äôs just the amount they‚Äôre expecting after you created the shipment from China to Amazon. It looks like they‚Äôve already counted all your inventory, which is why the status is ‚Äúclosed.‚Äù Since there‚Äôs a discrepancy in the count, you‚Äôll just need to file a claim using your supplier‚Äôs invoice.
  - 2025-02-19 | Hi Thuy, I'm not entirely sure if I'm recalling this correctly, but I believe you can claim the discrepancy inventory with Amazon so they can investigate. Try this: 1. Go to the Shipping Queue and click on the shipping ID with the discrepancy. 2. In the Shipping Summary, head to the Problems tab. 3. You should see an option to file the claim there.

  - 2025-02-14 | Thank you, Tim
  - 2025-02-12 | Thanks for sharing! I knew that when I arrange shipping, it gets to the port and then UPS or another US carrier takes over, but I didn‚Äôt realize we could choose the carrier from China to the US. Can you explain more about how you‚Äôre able to pick Matson for shipping from the supplier to the US?
  - 2025-02-12 | Thanks for sharing your advice! I really appreciate  it!
  - 2025-02-11 | From my experience, there‚Äôs no real difference between fast and regular sea shipping. For my first bulk order, I used both, and they arrived just two days apart.
  - 2025-02-11 | I see! Thanks you.
  - 2025-02-11 | Usually, Amazon doesn‚Äôt charge a fee when I select five warehouses instead of three or fewer. Did you create multiple shipments to compare quotes and choose the most cost-effective option?
  - 2025-02-11 | Thanks Eleni!  So there's a fee for selecting  warehouses location, but it helps save on shipping costs. Is that right?
  - 2025-02-11 | Hi Tim! Could you explain how to choose warehouses when creating a shipment in Seller Central? I‚Äôve always just gone with whatever they assign.

  - 2025-01-31 | Hi Thuy,
This warning isn‚Äôt too serious and should disappear after 14 days. Try to ship your order as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours. I also updated the handling time on seller central, but we can‚Äôt predict if the carrier might delay the delivery.
  - 2025-01-19 | I think it depends on your end goal. If your focus is on maximizing profit while maintaining steady sales, then this might be your sweet spot. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre prioritizing gathering PPC data, increasing sales volume, and boosting your ranking, it could be better to set a lower price to attract more buyers and drive more sales.
  - 2025-01-18 | <@1292032925964959755>
  - 2025-01-18 | Yes! When my inventory dropped to 50 units, I started slowly raising the price by $2 every three days. I did this about five times until sales slowed down a lot (like 2 sales or less per day) for two days in a row. Then, I lowered the price back to the previous level, and that turned out to be the sweet spot. Somehow, this strategy worked even though my ranking wasn‚Äôt great, and I also cut back on PPC spending.

By adapting and expsnding into retail, he stayed ahead of the competition. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder to stay persistent, think outside the box, and keep pushing forward. Looking forward to his upcomign guest speaker session. üëç

  - 2024-12-28 | I‚Äôd happily send you my new and upgrade product over for a review without a second thought‚Äîonly if you‚Äôre up for it, of course!  üòÅ
  - 2024-12-28 | Good question! I'm curious to know too. ü§£
  - 2024-12-11 | 4. To truly connect with others, you need to know and love yourself first. When you understand your own feelings, needs, and experiences, it makes it easier to be compassionate towards others. Self-awareness helps you set boundaries, communicate better, and take care of your own well-being. Loving yourself isn‚Äôt just for self-care. It‚Äôs about being able to show that same love and understanding to the people around you.
  - 2024-12-11 | 3.  You‚Äôre only getting older, and a year from now, you‚Äôll be the same person you are today, just with more fine lines and gray hair. The difference between where you are now and where you could be is the effort you put in today. Small, consistent actions add up over time and lead to big changes. Don‚Äôt waste another year. Take action now and make it count!
  - 2024-12-11 | 1. Don‚Äôt fear failure: It‚Äôs better to fail at something you care about than not try at all. Every success has failure behind it. Learn from it, grow, and keep going. Failure is just part of the process. Take the leap and you‚Äôll be glad you did!

2, Invest in yourself early: Whether it's learning new skills or taking care of your health and your appearances, start early. It pays off in the long run and your future self will thank you.

  - 2025-02-09 | Here are some helpful keywords for product research. They saved me a lot of time!  Avoid products that come in sets or kits, as they often have multiple parts, making them more complicated and less ideal for a first product to sell on Amazon.  Other places to search for product ideas include Amazon Influencer Storefronts, UGC influencer social media pages (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, etc.), and top-ranking products on Alibaba.

  - 2024-12-28 | Shifu emphasized the importance of not jumping to conclu sions about someone based on somthing you don‚Äôt like or a rumor you‚Äôve heard. In busines, it‚Äôs always better to make friends than enemie because you never know when you might need their support. Keep an open mind, avoid burning bridges, and ap proach relationships with understanding and respect.
  - 2024-12-28 | Make daily/weekly schedules for business tasks.
Ask mom for help with daily task at home
Simplify life decision: Only wear black and white shirt, have fewer options for daily life
  - 2024-12-28 | Time management
  - 2024-12-28 | Shiny object syndrome
  - 2024-12-28 | Hire VAs based on skill:
Low-skill: $3-5/hour (Philippines/Vietnam).
High-skill: ~$10/hour.
Start small: Test people with weekend tasks for proactivity and work ethic.
Use clear job descriptions  for hiring.
When to Leave the Day Job
Don‚Äôt quit until:
Business income is steady for 6 months or more.
Emergency fund is ready: Have atleast 6 months of income in the bank.
Use job income to fund and test my business ideas.
Scaling Smartly
First product needs to be smooth and profitable before launching the next.
Create SOPs before scaling.
Hire one VA per product as I expand.
Avoiding Distractions
  - 2024-12-28 | Don‚Äôt Quit the 9-5 Too Soon:

Wait until my business income consistently matches or exceeds my job income.
Build a 6-12 month emergency fund before making the leap.
Systems First, Then Scale:

Build strong operational systems and hire reliable VAs before adding more products.
Stay Focused:

Avoid shiny object syndrome (crypto, dropshipping, etc.).
Only diversify when my primary business is stable and predictable.

  - 2025-02-20 | Haha, Alice! If only we could trade. I'd happily swap my hair for yours! üòÅ
  - 2025-02-16 | I have both! üò´  But hair loss feels easier to manage.
  - 2025-02-16 | I don‚Äôt have any specific tips for crow‚Äôs feet. My skincare routine is pretty basic, but I like to drink collagen ampoules, take vitamin C, and other supplements daily.
  - 2025-02-16 | It's look good on you.
  - 2025-02-16 | Your hair is blond, so it‚Äôs not as noticeable!
  - 2025-02-16 | Any tips for keeping my natural hair color? I‚Äôd love to avoid dyeing it, but ever since starting this Amazon journey, my hair seems to be graying faster than ever! ü§£

  - 2025-02-10 | Interesting! I have a Galaxy S23 Ultra, but I'm not sure if it supports eSIM. I‚Äôll look into it‚Äîthanks, Louis!
  - 2024-12-21 | When optimizing my ASIN campaign, I go to the search term, click on "matched product" to group the ASINs into matched categories, and then identify the ASINs with high clicks but no sales to add them as negative targets. Am I approaching this correctly? <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-12-20 | Got it! Thanks, Susan!
  - 2024-12-20 | This keyword is one of the main ones. I initially set the bid at $4, but I gradually lowered it to $2.58. It has a total of 68 clicks not 30 üòÅ and 1 sale, resulting in an ACOS of 123%.
  - 2024-12-20 | When I check the targeting, I see that keyword has 30 clicks but no sales. I've been lowering the bid for it‚Äîis that good enough?
  - 2024-12-20 | When reviewing the search terms in my broad campaign, I notice many customer search terms related to a keyword I‚Äôm targeting, but most have only one click each. However, there‚Äôs one search term that matches the keyword exactly and has 13 clicks. Should I add the targeted keyword to the negative keyword list? <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-12-04 | thanks Chloe!

  - 2024-10-08 | I followed the instructions in the vault to create the campaigns, but I didn't see any mention of entering the launch bid. Is that something we don't need to do yet? <@536075832658231299>

  - 2025-02-12 | Would it be risky if the influencer mentions in the video that customers should scan the QR code for product registration, access to exclusive benefits, and important updates?
  - 2025-02-04 | Yes! Make sure to update your window, or Amazon may send you a warning.
  - 2025-02-04 | And also try to negotiate for free sample
  - 2025-02-04 | From my experience with ordering samples, it‚Äôs okay to use slower shipping for the first one or two since it will take some time to find more suppliers anyway. Once you've got a few options lined up, you can choose faster shipping for the 3rd or 4th sample. This way, all the samples will arrive around the same time, and you‚Äôll save some money with slower shipping on the first few.

  - 2025-01-28 | The FBA fees might not be accurate if the product is currently out of stock.
  - 2025-01-28 | Only refferal fees are about the same. FBM doesn't have storage fees and shipping fees.
  - 2025-01-24 | I did what Chloe and Trish did with their supplier. Besides having a term in your contract for handling returns or warranty claims, building that personal relationship with your supplier makes a big difference. They‚Äôre usually happy to send spare parts, boxes, accessories, and sometimes even extra units. These can be used for warranty claims or repacking for resale. It‚Äôs easier for them to do that upfront rather than have you contact them every time you need something. You just have to pay for the shipping to get the goods sent to you. They like it when you keep it simple for them, and it‚Äôs a win-win because you get what you need to keep your business running smoothly.

  - 2024-12-03 | Why is this keyword get a 15% increase in bid and not 20% ? <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-12-02 | Got it! Thanks
  - 2024-12-02 | This might be a silly question, but in the video, Susan mentioned picking the longest date range you‚Äôve been selling. Does that mean it‚Äôs not from when I last optimized until now? <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-24 | Thanks Han! That's what I'm trying to figure out is how I can determine the next bid according to the recorded data. Is it too new to see the pattern?
  - 2024-10-24 | Is the rule for setting a new bid for ASIN targets different from that for keywords? I've noticed that ASINs with no clicks have had their bids increased by 7 to 10%. If I need to set the new bid manually, how can I determine the appropriate percentage to increase it by?
  - 2024-10-24 | Could you please explain why the PPC assistant set the new bid 8% higher than the CPC for this ASIN target? <@536075832658231299>
  - 2025-01-25 | Yay... found it! Thanks Han!
  - 2025-01-25 | I tried expanding it, but it‚Äôs not there. I even went back to the template you shared in 2025, and it‚Äôs still missing.

  - 2025-01-25 | The link for 2025 sheet is module 5.
  - 2025-01-25 | The visibility sheet I‚Äôve been using is from last year, and it doesn‚Äôt include the three columns for profit, ROI, and AOV. How can I add those? I‚Äôve tried copying and pasting in different ways, but the formulas don‚Äôt seem to carry over properly. Could you please explain the best way to combine these 2 sheets? <@536075832658231299>
  - 2025-01-25 | <@536075832658231299> In your lesson about data visibility, does the breakeven CPA need to factor in the return rate for better accuracy, or is it fine to exclude it? Also, when calculating the AOV for replacement orders, why did you divide by 3? Where does that number come from? Could you please explain?

  - 2025-02-21 | 
  - 2025-02-21 | Thank you, Susan
  - 2025-02-21 | Susan is still working on the new main image. Should I go ahead with the relaunch with video ads even though the new image isn‚Äôt on the listing yet?
  - 2025-02-21 | ü§û
  - 2025-02-21 | I just contacted Amazon Advertising, followed your instructions, and they created a case. Now, I just have to wait for a reply from Advertiser Support.
  - 2025-02-21 | Yes! I have the brand video
  - 2025-02-21 | NVM - I found it üéâ ü•≤
  - 2025-02-21 | I'm trying to locate the original copywriting but couldn't find it. I was only able to find the closest version, which I modified slightly to reflect the accessory upgrades. However, it's not the exact version currently on the listing. Do you think it's okay to use this one?
  - 2025-02-21 | Yes! The main video is still in the listing. And I have a copy in my computer
  - 2025-02-21 | Do you recommend resolving this issue first and then relaunching, or should I run video ads in the meantime?
  - 2025-02-21 | Okay
  - 2025-02-21 | My first step is to revert the copywriting back to its original version. Then, I will contact them to explain that the marketing team made an error with the copywriting and request permission to resume advertising after correcting the issue. Is that the correct approach?
  - 2025-02-21 | Do I change the copt writing back to the original?
  - 2025-02-21 | I tweaked the copywriting yesterday. could that be the reason for this issue?
  - 2025-02-20 | 
  - 2025-02-20 | I did created new SKU for the new inventory. Could it be the reason for this issue?
  - 2025-02-20 | For some reason the new inventory is not eligible for PPC advertising. This is the reasons they gave me: Ineligible product
This product can not be advertised because:
The product isn't compliant with weightloss and weight management policies.

  - 2025-02-18 | okay! Thank you üôÇ
  - 2025-02-18 | My FBA inventory is gradually becoming available, with only 7 units currently listed and ready for sale.

  - 2025-02-09 | Thank you, Susan! I have 15 more from customer returns that I can use for warranty claims and influencer marketing. I'm just waiting for the new accessories and packaging to arrive so I can send them out. Let me know if you know someone who might be interested. I‚Äôd be happy to give them away in exchange for a review! üòä
  - 2025-02-09 | I have 14 new units from my first bulk order that were shipped back to me due to the product safety incident. I want to give them away to generate more reviews.

  - 2025-01-30 | okay
  - 2025-01-30 | speaking of delivery window....do we have an tutorial video on how to edit it? I couldn't figure it out.
  - 2025-01-30 | In addition to the two issues above, I have one Shipping ID that should include six cartons, but the UPS tracking system only shows five. I was informed that they are looking into it to locate the missing carton.
  - 2025-01-30 | My shipping agent won‚Äôt have the tracking number until she returns from the holiday. In the meantime, I‚Äôll try entering a random tracking number into Seller Central just so it appears in the shipment. However, I‚Äôll likely receive a warning message when Amazon processes the late-shipped carton. Is this the best I can do or there's another way to approach this issue?
  - 2025-01-30 | I were able to entered these tracking number into the system without any issue.
  - 2025-01-30 | It turns out they shipped 10 cartons via FedEx to two warehouses, 5 cartons per warehouse. The two Shipping IDs assigned to the warehouses only have FedEx tracking information.

I just finished updating the data visibility sheet and wanted to let you know in case you‚Äôd like to take a look at it. I‚Äôll also be submitting the PPC tracking sheet by tomorrow.
  - 2025-01-22 | I plan to close the variation for the older version of the travel bag once it sells out.
  - 2025-01-22 | I have an order of 500 units: 250 with the travel bag from my first order and 250 with the new travel bag. Can I create two variations on the listing for these? Also, do I need to set up two separate shipments in Seller Central? If so, is there an instruction guide on how to add variations?
  - 2025-01-16 | The fivver vender is asking for child access to my seller central. Is it safe to grant him this access?
  - 2025-01-14 | Okay! Got it!

  - 2025-02-07 | Thank so much <@1054411267340763216> ! I always have questions. üòÜ
  - 2025-02-04 | Do you mean ask questions using the Airtable form? I don't see where to sign up for the class session.
  - 2025-02-04 | Hi Shifu! The two videos above are the same. üòÑ
  - 2025-01-22 | Thanks, Chloe!
  - 2025-01-22 | Does Amazon take the same amount of time to process and input inventory into their warehouse, whether we ship it ourselves (ship back returns)  or directly from China?
  - 2025-01-13 | I think all all of them do free review.  The last 4 I added is in the shoppable sheet.
  - 2025-01-07 | Side note: I‚Äôve noticed that all of my shoppable videos are now posted in the top carousel. Previously, Amazon only allowed 3 or 4 shoppable videos, but now they‚Äôre all displayed. Is anyone else experiencing this? This is great news!
  - 2025-01-07 | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oIx47VyH_1377MokuX_JbVu5AE7_dJxL8TVxeMKO4i8/edit?gid=879636002#gid=879636002
  - 2025-01-07 | I‚Äôve added four shoppable influencers to the list. They collaborate free of charge‚Äîyou just need to send them your product. They don‚Äôt work with a script, as their review videos have a more authentic, natural flow. What I do is send a letter along with the product, outlining its benefits, features, and expressing gratitude. These influencers are professionals who typically do this on the side, so they can be selective about the products they choose to promote or review. However, their video content is very informative. If your niche requires educating customers with a lot of information, these influencers could be a great fit. Hope this helps!
  - 2025-01-06 | Thanks so much  <@536075832658231299>  <@1066465177140215928> ! ü´∂
  - 2025-01-06 | I couldn't find the video for 12/10. ü´§
  - 2025-01-06 | I'm not the only one who overlooked this campaign! üòÇ
  - 2025-01-06 | Oh, I see! It's another auto campaign. So, should the bids be set between $0.15 and $0.25 regardless of the niche, correct?
  - 2025-01-05 | Well, in my situation, Han told me to launch before having the launch call with him, so I didn‚Äôt set up the Ultimate Campaign initially. I think Han might have forgotten to set it up for me during our call. Later, I kept putting it off as I was busy with other things. I just remembered it now because, after turning off all my campaigns, I realized I still need the Ultimate Campaign running. Thanks to Carolina for helping me understand that we need to keep the Ultimate Campaign on, even after turning off all other campaigns when stock runs low!
  - 2025-01-05 | This might be a dumb question, but do we have a tutorial for the Ultimate Campaign? I didn‚Äôt have this campaign option when I set up my campaigns, as it wasn‚Äôt included in Module 5. I remember @Han mentioning it during one of the class sessions, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find the video for that lesson. Could someone point me in the right direction?
  - 2025-01-31 | Just my two cent,  but tag whoever lets you! More exposure is always better.  I tagged all  of my siblings. ü§£ ü§£ ü§£
  - 2025-02-13 | thank you so much, Minh

  - 2024-11-04 | Since I am still in the product research phase, that's my one and only focus now. If you want, I can send a daily update late at night giving you updates on what I've done that day.

My strategy so far has been using TikTok for product ideas then hopping on AMZ and using Helium to see if it's a viable product and updating my product tracking sheet. Let me know  if you see a way to improve things.
  - 2024-11-03 | Hi brother! As you know, I am still in the product research phase. The last few weeks have been challenging but I am praying and staying positive. During the last few weeks I have finalized my divorce and my priority has been my 5 year old son Alex. I have finally found an apartment and some stability for him and me. The divorce has not been easy on my son and he has had a lot of behavioral issues which we are seeing a counselor for.  Right now is the most stability I have had in over 1 year. I know I haven't been able to stay consistent in this program. Raniel is my accountability partner and Olesia has been a HUGE help. All this is to say that I have struggled. I'm not looking for sympathy, ultimately, I need to be more accountable and  I have no one to blame but myself.  Life is not easy and everyone has some form of issues related to health/life/children. It is a part of life. Having said all of this, I promise you I will hold myself to higher standards and be more accountable and submit homework on a regular basis going forward. Please write me up next time I don't submit a homework.
  - 2024-10-21 | <@1266755529984835626>  and I are partnering up as accountability partners.

My supplier‚Äôs extended holiday delayed the restocking of my product. I couldn‚Äôt get the new shipments in time to meet demand, which led to out-of-stock situations for key items.

  - 2025-02-17 | Hi Mercede
When you apply an Amazon coupon, the 15% referral fee is calculated based on the discounted price, not the original price.
For example, if your item is originally priced at $60 and you offer a $10 coupon, the referral fee and FBA fee will be based on the $50 sale price, not the $60 original price.

  - 2025-02-11 | you also will receive an email from Amazon if they need you to verify the information
  - 2025-02-11 | You're good now. If you see the warning notice from Account Health, you only need to click the verification button sis
  - 2025-02-11 | It looked like you verified it, you can go to Account Health for double check
  - 2025-02-11 | Go to the Menu-> Performance-> Account Health
  - 2025-02-11 | The US INFORM Act is important for both Amazon and its sellers because it promotes consumer safety, reduces fraudulent activity, and ensures that the marketplace remains trustworthy. If you‚Äôre a seller, it‚Äôs best to ensure you meet the new verification requirements to avoid disruptions in your Amazon business.

After filing a claim, they contacted me immediately to ask to cancel the claim and will push to deliver my shipment asap. I canceled the claim and they delivered my goods to Amazon after two days, this is my experience. May I ask who made the contract?

  - 2025-01-06 | Tell them you will give them the shipping address later
At this time, you only need to negotiate and compare the price with suppliers
  - 2025-01-05 | I also would like to introduce <@1066465177140215928> is a client success manager who is supporting us as a listing creation agent. She also can direct you with design packaging
  - 2025-01-05 | Sorry for make you confused
For example, my cost of product is $15/units and my packaging customization fee is 0.5/box(MOQ 500 boxes). So I negotiated with my supplier and paid: $4500 (cost of 300units) + $250 (500 customization boxes)
  - 2025-01-05 | I paid 300 units (included cost of product and customization packaging) + 200 (only customization packaging fee) because of the MOQ packaging is 500 boxes
  - 2025-01-04 | You can ask supplier apply a sticker logo on the main product for your first order. 
My first order is 300 units, my supplier said the MOQ for customization packaging are 500 boxes. I need to pay 300 units and 200 customization packaging.
  - 2025-01-03 | Yes you can
Have you tried the models from competitors? You can order one from Amazon to compare the pros and cons of the new and old models, and then return it.
  - 2025-01-03 | Let me know if you have any questions, I'm here for helping üòä
  - 2025-01-03 | Hi Ivy
Happy New Year to you and your family!
I suggest you should talk with your supplier about the model first and thinking about add-on products.
  - 2024-12-31 | Hi Ivy, I recommend writing down the pros and cons of the top seller (old model) and the new seller (new model). While the new product seems to be receiving a positive reception based on reviews, the fact that it‚Äôs new doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will maintain its momentum. Take a look at customer reviews for both the new product and the old one. Are there any unmet needs or complaints that you can address in your design? If you find any common pain points, you can focus on solving them in your model and add valuable bundles, which might give you an edge.

  - 2025-01-04 | Hi <@1302992418341261386> 

Yes, the "deliver to" location can matter when using both Amazon and Helium10

For Amazon, the delivery address impacts factors like shipping fees, delivery time, and product availability. Some sellers might only offer shipping to specific countries or regions, and the product price could vary based on the delivery location. Helium 10 show different results based on your location, reflecting region-specific demand or competition.

  - 2024-12-13 | you can choose the downgrade to the individual selling plan now until you start to bulk order and upgrade to the professional plan
  - 2024-12-13 | Yes please choose downgrade
  - 2024-12-12 | You haven't started selling on Amazon yet, so change to an individual selling plan and you won't bear a subscription fee per month
  - 2024-12-12 | Hi <@1302992418341261386> 
For Amazon sellers, a monthly subscription fee typically refers to the cost of using Amazon's selling platform. There are two main types of selling accounts, each with its associated subscription fee:

1. Individual Selling Plan:
No monthly fee: You don't pay a monthly subscription fee, but you will incur a $0.99 fee per item sold (in addition to other selling fees like referral fees and shipping costs).
This plan is best for sellers who expect to sell fewer than 40 items per month.

2. Professional Selling Plan:
$39.99 per month 
This plan allows you to sell more than 40 items per month, and it comes with additional features like access to Amazon‚Äôs advertising tools, bulk listing, and advanced reporting.

Hi all, I would like to provide an update regarding <@1256370194071289907> who has been quiet in the community due to family issues. He had a logo, trademark, and LLC, but his last product didn‚Äôt perform well, so he was close to launching it. He has a few new products in mind, but due to unforeseen circumstances, he had to put those plans on hold. He will focus his time on this again.

teas@usptogov.co with subject line: U.S Trademark Application Verification - 'trademark name‚Äô

And further information below:

Hello,

Your trademark application is now live and is ready to be verified, attested & endorsed so the authorities can reserve the trademarks with all Secretary of State(s) in the US in order to mark your business as a certified business under federal protection in the USA.

The following verification would include:

*Owner's verification including name, serial number(s) address how long the business has been in use what goods & services are offered for your position in the company

*Prescribed federal obligation(s) IF REQUIRED

Legal Entity Type: LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY
‚Ä¶‚Äù

Has anyone received some kind of email like this? I checked uspto and the correct email from the USPTO ends in @uspto.gov.
