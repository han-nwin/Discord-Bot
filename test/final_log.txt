  - 2024-10-08 | Hi! Im Alice from Sweden.❄️ 
Heres my video presentation, my vision board and my personality test result. 
Happy to join and looking forward to LEARN EVERYTHING! 😀 

https://youtu.be/m_8Frwlyqzk
  - 2024-11-06 | Thank you so much! And for all your help <@1054411267340763216> 🙏⭐️
  - 2024-11-01 | Same for me…. Have been waiting for 20 min. Maybe I misunderstood the time or day?
  - 2024-10-23 | Ah, thanks! Had not figured that out until now. 🙂
  - 2024-10-23 | <@1054411267340763216>  can I please get the recordning from yesterdays class? 🙂 It was 03.00 am for me at that time...
  - 2024-10-15 | Sweden
  - 2024-11-12 | when are you coming to Sweden ? 😄
  - 2024-10-10 | AliceSvensson - alices_01314
  - 2024-10-24 | Thank you Olesia for answering me so quickly 🙂
  - 2024-10-24 | This is probably a really stupid question... But, what does N/A mean? Sometimes when I use the Helium10 tool to do PR it says för example " Total revenue N/A" at the summary. Why is that?

  - 2024-11-15 | Do you think its ok even tho its in the baby-category?  if yes, ill start contacting suppliers and work on my profit-calculation. If you dont recommend to go with that product because of the "catagory" I have another ont that might be a potential product.
  - 2024-11-15 | The product that was "ok" is this one https://www.amazon.com/s?k=baby%20lounger%20nest%20portable&ref=glow_cls&refresh=1
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you <@1054411267340763216> for being so helpful and for all your patience
  - 2024-11-11 | Ok, thank you <@1054411267340763216>  ! That was my guess too, but I find the product super interesting since it’s the NO 1 baby product in Scandinavia. It’s a genius product. Too bad it’s not that big in the US yet. Thanks for your good advice as always 🙏🫶
  - 2024-11-11 | Here it is 🙂
  - 2024-11-10 | H i again!Sorry for bothering with all these question... But the reason I dont want to ask this one officially is because its about a very spceial product that I would like to keep secret until I know how to deal with it. Hope its ok. 
In Sweden there is a product called "vibrating stroller rocket". Its universal for all baby strollers and puts the baby to sleep. Its a VERY popular product in Sweden. So I did some PR on Amazon and I noticed that this product isnt really big yet in the US. There is a couple of sellers making ok profit.  Is this a "dangerous" product to work with or how come the number of sellers are so few? Also a product I should stay away from? Or do you think I can go deeper with the anlysis? 

Heres the product https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHFDJ6P9?psc=1
  - 2024-11-09 | Ok, got it! ☺️ Thanks Han! ⭐️🙏
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi guys! Hope u are fine ☺️ just a quick question about my PR since I needed to cancel my product “cordless table lamp rechargeable”. Is it just that kind of model that is on your black list? Or is it lightning over all? Would you recommend me to stay away from all kind of lamps?
  - 2024-10-28 | 
  - 2024-10-28 | Ah, I just saw that the class tomorrow is at 2 am in the morning for me. 😕  So I will not be able to attend. But I can attend the class at Friday if there is any?
  - 2024-10-28 | If i want to to bring a product up in the meeting for analyse, do I need to send any form to you before the class? 🙂
  - 2024-10-26 | Perfect, thank you so much for that! What do I need to prepare for that class? 🙂
  - 2024-10-26 | For me, the schedule looks like this with my timezone.
  - 2024-10-26 | So, Ive been trying to analyse around 15-20 products now. But since the class with you <@1054411267340763216> at wednesdays are at 3 am in the morning for me, I havent been able to join and bring them up for feedback in the class. Can i bring it up at another class? The one on thursdays, mondays or saturdays? These ones are more easy for me to attend because of the timezone... Or will that be the wrong forum for this?
  - 2024-10-21 | Thanks <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out... Really appreciate! Been feeling kind of lonely the past week. Its so hard to keep up with the classes since im in a different time zone. Even tho I watch the recordings I feel like Im behind since I dint get the same chance to participate live and ask questions... But I do my best! 🙂 

Last week I leared how to use the PR-tracking sheet and I tried a lot of different tools in Helium10. Not sure how good my draft is but there is 7 products in my tracking sheet right now that Ive been practicing to analyze.  I try to find one product for each day. to analyze and find an opportunity with.
  - 2024-10-11 | I've been focused on taking care of all the formalities for the last two days as I couldn't sign up for an Amazon account without having a company specifically dedicated to this in Sweden. My accountant has helped me set this up, and it will take three business days after we applied for approval from the government yesterday. It's a bit of a longer startup process for me since I need to follow Swedish regulations, and it will cost me about 3,000 USD extra.  (good to know if there will be any other students from Sweden in the future) By Tuesday at the latest, all the paperwork should be done, and my company will be up and running, which means I can sign up for an Amazon Seller account then. In the meantime, I’ve done as much product research as I can 🙂 Do you recommend me to attend class tomorrow anyway? Or should I keep doing the product research instead?
  - 2024-10-10 | Wonderful, thanks 🙂
  - 2024-11-01 | Yes, we have matched up. Me and <@772970575144288288>  🙂
  - 2024-10-22 | Perfect! <@772970575144288288>
  - 2024-10-21 | My location is Sweden and my timezone is  GMT+2, my strengths is my energy and 
willingness to learn. Im a "protoganist" in the personality test 🙂

  - 2024-11-15 | Yes please send them to me in my dm, thank you <@1172937966855917613>
  - 2024-11-15 | Yes , you need to get your account activated again in order to get approved for your brand registry 

Send me all of your documents : product images and contract 
So I can review everything and support you further more on this case <@1172937966855917613>
  - 2024-11-15 | 1. You can apply for brand registry with a pending trademark ( you don’t need to wait for a full approval)
2. The Shifus just updated a new process of brand approval without trademark and brand registry. ( If you’ve paid for your trademark then you can continue with the old process)
Did you pay for the law firm to work on your trademark? <@1172937966855917613>
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi <@1172937966855917613> did you get approved for your trademark ?
  - 2024-11-11 | Hey brother <@1271018123725770762>

  - 2024-09-26 | Help Vietnam’s Storm Yagi Victims:
Let’s Do More Together!

What Happened?
Storm Yagi hit Vietnam with devastating force, leaving entire communities in ruins. Heavy rains and winds displaced thousands, flooding homes and destroying vital infrastructure. Many families are now left without shelter, food, or access to medical care. The destruction is widespread, with entire villages submerged under water and roads washed away. The storm has created a humanitarian crisis, and immediate relief is critical to help these communities rebuild and recover. Your support can bring hope to those affected by this disaster.

How Can We Help?


Dear AMZ Shifu family,

We’ve already donated $4,000 to aid the victims of Storm Yagi in Vietnam, but the need is still overwhelming. Thousands of families have lost their homes and are in urgent need of support. We’re now reaching out to our incredible community to join us in making a bigger difference.

Even a small contribution can go a long way in providing food, shelter, and medical aid. Let’s stand together to help those in need.

Please donate today: https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/PW6NVEZZ2H3SN
Organization: https://www.khbetterfuture.org/

Thank you for your kindness and generosity!
With gratitude,

Justin & Charlie

  - 2024-01-16 | Hi everyone

@Christopher Villanueva  is trying to raise funds to finish equipping his new tutoring hall he has created in the Philippines to help all the kids in that small village. He has listed items on the fundraiser that we need to still purchase to begin enrollment in February, so we are hoping to receive all funds before then.

Also, any person donating $500 or more will be considered a founding sponsor and will have their name placed on a permanent plaque on the building.

I think this is a good time to give back, to help more and more people and a fresh start for 2024. For any additional information, feel free to ask here or send Christopher a message.

After you sold out, you will gather all of the feedback from customers to improve your product.

  - 2024-10-29 | Hi <@505081578247159830> usually you will need to wait a couple hours so the UPC you've purchased will be verified in Amazon system, let me know if you still have the same issue in the next 3 hours
  - 2024-10-21 | Great job on this one <@505081578247159830> , yes please continue on your product research
  - 2024-10-21 | I saw the link Hannah 
It's a Wireless Car stereo-compatible

We don't recommend this market :
1. This category has a high return rate compared with other category
2. This category is very competitive, new sellers are trying to undercut pricing, and you also will get attacks from CN sellers
3. We experienced a higher rate of having Hijacker in this category

  - 2024-10-21 | let me know if you have any questions
Again, confirm with me whenever you are done with your profit calculation sheet, we need to make sure it's more than 30% 😊
  - 2024-10-21 | Thank you sis <@505081578247159830> just want to make sure it's not in the Car-Electric category

Good job on this one, you can start on module #2
1. Create a dummy listing for this product
2. Practice communicating with your supplier
3. Work on your profit calculation sheet: make sure it's more than 30%
  - 2024-10-21 | Can you please tell me the category of this product first before we process to the next step ? 
Thank you <@505081578247159830>
  - 2024-10-21 | Please watch this and let me know if you have any question <@505081578247159830>

  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks Phuong sis! Thanks for reminding me these! Yah, trying all these as well. 🥰🥰🥰😘😘
  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks a lot Olesia sis! Yr words motivate me! . 🥰🥰😘😘😘
  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks <@931213533134344222>. Yr words assure me. 🥰🥰
  - 2024-10-10 | <@1054411267340763216> i still cannot find my potential product despite trying the methods. Any further tips?
  - 2024-10-03 | <@1054411267340763216> If a product can be operated by battery or use cable charging, we should delete the Helium 10 listings which indicate battery and keep those with cable charging, for more accurate comparison among same products ? I am looking at a potential product with cable charging. Thanks
  - 2024-10-29 | If not wrong, it should be Tues evening USA time, not morning
  - 2024-10-15 | Singapore
  - 2024-11-12 | We only look at ASIN revenue right?
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Minh, sorry I didnt join today call due to last min work issue. I submitted my potential product yesterday. Can help me take a look and give me advice? Thanks a lot!
  - 2024-10-29 | Hi Minh, I have just submitted my PR Homework for 1 potential product. Thanks
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi Minh, thanks for yr help as always! I will forgo this product and am still looking for other potential product instead.
  - 2024-10-21 | Hi Minh, thanks for analysing.

1. Moving forward, I need to submit the Product Research Tracking Sheet or Product Research Homework via airtable? I am quite confused.

2. The top AMZ with highest 1,342 counts is a AMZ resale, but there is also another AMZ seller in the middle not doing good sales. I thought it might be good.

2. As long as the top revenue sellers are from CN and US sellers are in between, it should be ok?
  - 2024-10-30 | 1. Continue to search for my potential product.
2. Finish module 1

  - 2024-11-03 | Hi everyone,
I want to start by expressing how truly inspired and optimistic I feel reading about all your wins. You all are incredible and serve as a great motivation! This mentorship is truly something else!
Since joining the SHIFU mentorship program in May, I've taken some time off and returned, and like many of you, I've faced life challenges and problems with consistency. While my wins may not be the traditional milestones, I’d like to share some personal wins from the past couple of months:
1.    I’ve established a safe and consistent routine for my 5-year-old son while balancing full-time work as a single dad.
2.    I’ve prioritized my mental health to be the best dad I can for my son, Alex.
3.    I’ve focused on shifting my mindset to overcome self-limiting beliefs.
4.    I’ve committed to going to the gym five days a week—something I’ve never done before!
5.    I’m continuing my product research phase.
In my next update, I hope to share some more tangible wins related to AMZ! Wishing you all continued success and may GOD continue to bless you all! 😊

-Mirza
  - 2024-05-11 | Thank you Olesia! 😃
  - 2024-10-13 | Me too!!! 💩
  - 2024-11-06 | Me too
  - 2024-10-15 | USA
  - 2024-11-12 | Does anyone know the difference between ASIN revenue and Parent Level Revenue? HELIUM 10
  - 2024-11-04 | Since I am still in the product research phase, that's my one and only focus now. If you want, I can send a daily update late at night giving you updates on what I've done that day.

My strategy so far has been using TikTok for product ideas then hopping on AMZ and using Helium to see if it's a viable product and updating my product tracking sheet. Let me know  if you see a way to improve things.
  - 2024-11-03 | Hi brother! As you know, I am still in the product research phase. The last few weeks have been challenging but I am praying and staying positive. During the last few weeks I have finalized my divorce and my priority has been my 5 year old son Alex. I have finally found an apartment and some stability for him and me. The divorce has not been easy on my son and he has had a lot of behavioral issues which we are seeing a counselor for.  Right now is the most stability I have had in over 1 year. I know I haven't been able to stay consistent in this program. Raniel is my accountability partner and Olesia has been a HUGE help. All this is to say that I have struggled. I'm not looking for sympathy, ultimately, I need to be more accountable and  I have no one to blame but myself.  Life is not easy and everyone has some form of issues related to health/life/children. It is a part of life. Having said all of this, I promise you I will hold myself to higher standards and be more accountable and submit homework on a regular basis going forward. Please write me up next time I don't submit a homework.
  - 2024-10-21 | <@1266755529984835626>  and I are partnering up as accountability partners.

  - 2024-11-15 | I had the stock with me. I asked AMZ to send it back to me so I can close my listing. Feels weird to pack your own product and send it to customer hahaha. It was my first time lol.
  - 2024-11-15 | this happened to me too. I left my FBM open for FBM  F&F reviews and also because I have 2 units left from my 1st batch which I withdraw from AMZ warehouse. Then 2 random buyers bought those 2 units for FBM price. Just hoping that they are not hijackers lol
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Shifu, just to clarify. Is it okay to not do the storefront? And for your question, I did enroll for brand registry through suggested IP accelerator on amazon. 🙂
  - 2024-11-15 | I just realized after watching Wed class, I don't have a storefront yet. Can someone teach me how to do it? Or is there any video/module that explains how to do it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Thanka shifu. I had it sorted out. I called paypal.
  - 2024-11-13 | I helped with fbm purchase with one of the mentees and she paid me via paypal.  I received the payment but I also got this email about holding the payment. 

It was recognized as a “business payment” to me and is asking me to put my tax ID on my paypal account. Should I just put my EIN?

My main concern is, this is not related with my business. Will this affect me during tax audits?

Thank you.
  - 2024-11-07 | Can we have the link for class recording today? shifu <@536075832658231299>  Thank you.

  - 2024-07-21 | Thank you brother! Appreciate it!
  - 2024-05-10 | Thank you brother!
  - 2024-09-21 | Thank you brother.
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you!
  - 2024-11-13 | Is there a recording for today’s class?
  - 2024-11-07 | Is there a class recording?

  - 2024-04-11 | Thank you!
  - 2024-09-29 | Is this the csv file? You download this from campaign manager. Then you can send it via airtable using ppc assistant tool and they will adjust it for you.
  - 2024-09-29 | I think they said you need to make a copy and do not edit on the original copy.

  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-11-15 | If I am still out of stock. Can I skip this homework for now and just do it once I have my 2nd batch?
  - 2024-10-28 | Got it. Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-10-28 | I did. Also, ACOS there says 7k+ Whereas, when I use campaign manager from amazon seller account, it is only 5k+.. (after I filter the date range from launch date to the day I closed my listing)
  - 2024-10-28 | So when computing it manually. Do we just deduct COGS and shipping from payout? (Payout minus COGS + shipping) ??
  - 2024-10-28 | But the payout from amazon.. Do they deduct already the ACOS, seller fees, refunds, and coupon discounts?
  - 2024-10-28 | I did, it says 4.2k in net profit. Shifu Justin just told me to do this method because sometimes, the sellerboard data might be inaccurate or not updated yet?
  - 2024-10-28 | Just 300 USD left... Is it negative 8k because I deduct the 15k from (amazon fees, coupon, ACOS, refunds) where it was deducted already before sending the direct deposit to me?
  - 2024-10-28 | Shifu Justin told me to do this to keep track on my profit/expenses. I feel like I am doing something wrong because my net profit is negative. Did I deduct too much? meaning = Amazon already deducted it from the payout and I deducted more during my computation? Thank you in advance for helping me figure out the math lol
  - 2024-10-27 | Yes, it was all set. I messaged Tom and he reminded Justin. He was just in another meeting. Thank you!
  - 2024-10-26 | Hi, Shifu Justin scheduled a meeting today with me at 1:30 but he is not on our zoom call yet. Can someone remind him? Or do we need to reschedule? thank you..
  - 2024-10-25 | Thank you Shifu. Can I go ahead and send FBA labels to my supplier?
  - 2024-10-25 | I did not update the warning mentioned because I don’t see any “red” items that I need to update except for the listing price. After I updated the price, it is active now.

Should I go ahead and close it now? Or find the warning that they are telling?
  - 2024-10-25 | Now it says active, should I close the listing first while out of stock? shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-25 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> , I followed your video recording. My listing is back but it has some warnings/errors.. Please see the screenshot and let me know if there is anything I need to do?
  - 2024-10-25 | Okay. But the main reason I deleted my listing will be fixed? The fluid oz issue and the subscribe and save? 

Does it take 24 hours for my listing to be active again or more than 24 hours?
  - 2024-10-25 | Thank you for this. I will complete this tomorrow. When I submit this, is my listing back to normal? I don’t need to reupload the images? Videos? Bullet points?
  - 2024-10-25 | Oh no, time for an upgrade shifu. Maybe a urus like shifu justin haha
  - 2024-10-25 | No worries. Hope your car is doing good now.
  - 2024-10-24 | Shifu <@536075832658231299>  are we still meeting today or are you just going to send a recording?
  - 2024-10-24 | Thank you shifu!
  - 2024-10-24 | Shifu <@536075832658231299>  I will just send it here, there is a lot to screenshot on template tab and I might miss something. If you can make it tomorrow, is it the same time 5pm EST?
  - 2024-10-23 | Will send it to you once I get home. Thank you!
  - 2024-10-23 | Let me know what day works for you.
  - 2024-10-23 | shifu <@536075832658231299>  My excel is now working.
  - 2024-10-23 | yes
  - 2024-10-23 | got it. I can wait. No worries. 🙂
  - 2024-10-23 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> can you send the link for our 1on1 today?
  - 2024-10-21 | It is for fixing my listing. Correcting the "Fl oz" for unit count type because it confuses some of the customers thinking it is a liquid product. Also removing the subscribe and save option because this option seems for a product that needs replenishment every month like a liquid product..
  - 2024-10-21 | October 23rd? 5pm EST?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you shifu. Is there like a tracking number that we can monitor?
  - 2024-10-14 | They will just ship it to me?
  - 2024-10-14 | Is it this one shifu? Then just click review?
  - 2024-10-14 | Shifu <@536075832658231299> , now it is showing up. How do I request withdrawals to send the units back to my address?
  - 2024-10-14 | Okay, I closed the listing. I will wait for a few minutes/hours as the "stranded inventory" is still not showing up so far.
  - 2024-10-14 | Sorry shifu, can you further explain? 

Based from my understanding. Close the listing and ask amazon to send the units back to me? I am US based by the way.
  - 2024-10-14 | Or maybe, I can just save it for mcf orders if a customer requests a new unit? In case 1 unit is defective…
  - 2024-10-14 | Not until January.. they just started production a week ago. 

Should I close it still?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you. After I sold this 2 unit. Should I go ahead and close it again?
  - 2024-10-14 | I reopened it today. They just sent me an email today about that 2 units. Is it correct that I reopened it?
  - 2024-10-14 | Now it's saying I have 2 units available?
  - 2024-10-14 | Good morning.

Can someone help me with this? I’m pretty sure I sold out but wondering why it says stranded. Did I close my listing too early? Do I need to reactivate it? When I closed the listing before it says “0” available but there are still some units under “FC processing”
  - 2024-10-11 | Okay. I will tell them about the FBA label. But FNSKU, I can give them the old one and stick it on each unit packaging already?
  - 2024-10-11 | Not yet, they just want to get it to avoid delays. That's what they told me. But FBA labels are just outside of the cartons right?
  - 2024-10-11 | Okay, I will tell them to use the same FSNKU. What about the shipping label? Can I create one already or should I wait after our call?
  - 2024-10-11 | Hi shifu, just to make sure the only available dates are 10/21-10/24 right?
  - 2024-10-11 | Just tell them use the same FSNKU code? Will it be the same if I change my product title? Me and susan were trying to change it pre-launched but amazon is giving us an error.
  - 2024-11-07 | 1. Send FBA label to supplier 2. Watch class recording for Wed

  - 2024-10-10 | Thu Nguyen - thunguyen0056
  - 2024-08-19 | I remember from the tutorial that if the budget runs out in the afternoon, around 3-4 pm, should I increase the budget, or should I wait and optimize after two weeks?
  - 2024-11-09 | thank you Han! I will do it . I feel better now. I'm struggling in last couple weeks. It overload to me.
  - 2024-11-09 | So could I find a new keywords or still keep the old one? I haven't turn off auto and ultimate yet.
  - 2024-11-09 | I just concern that I take a look ppc in 2 weeks feel lost much money and don't get sales. 🙈
  - 2024-11-09 | So I can turn on ppc again when the inventory full?
  - 2024-11-09 | i don't optimize every day. in couple days, i take a look if keywords didn't make sales I will bids down or turn off.
  - 2024-11-09 | So, I don't keep in my eyes in ppc, it looks like spending much money but not sales. That's a reason I need someone ppc assitant in short term.
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi Han, 3 things are ppc, fbm review and post instagram in single day.
  - 2024-11-07 | Hi Han, how are you doing? Susan suggested me DM you to help. honestly  I am focus in my last semester to complete Master degree. My inventory is low. I turn off my ppc last week. The second bulk is in bound. Honestly I don't spend time in ppc much. Could I hire someone to take care of it for black Friday sales? Please advise, I'm a bit stressed now.
  - 2024-11-07 | Oh ok I will DM to Han. Thanks Susan!
  - 2024-11-07 | My inventory is low. I turn off my ppc last week. The second bulk is in bound. Honestly I don't spend time in ppc much. Could I hire someone to take care of it for black Friday sales? Please advise, I'm a bit stressed now.
  - 2024-11-07 | Hello, honestly  I am focus in my last semester to complete Master degree. I don't have time to join the class. Sorry about unconvinced. I need advice right now.
  - 2024-10-30 | can i send the spreadsheet to airtable to optimize ppc?
  - 2024-10-30 | Do I to research new key words in ppc for second bulk order?
  - 2024-10-23 | Can I sell another product while the selling the first one?
  - 2024-10-23 | My second bulk order on the way to warehouse. I also find influencer. And build up more reviews. Could I find another potential product?
  - 2024-10-15 | Thanks Susan! It's clarifying to me.

  - 2024-11-01 | I am curious. Once your shipment arrives to Amazon how long does it take for them to get it ready to ship out? Days? Weeks?

  - 2024-11-12 | <@308107877493768193> thank you. That helps out. So I would need my supplier to go ahead and separate  to ship to different locations?
  - 2024-11-12 | <@536075832658231299> you had mentioned that one box should not be over 50 pounds. Is that correct? Also, it’s better to ship to 5 different warehouses so that it will speed up the process at the warehouse and also cost less? Is that right? Just want to make sure I understood correctly? 😀

  - 2024-09-15 | But like they provided 2 addresses with tracking numbers, but the rest reference numbers, so I’m unable to input them into Amz tracking then received  email from Amz like you. Just acknowledged the submitted it
  - 2024-09-15 | From other shipping agent
  - 2024-09-15 | Same as me . I couldn't track with reference number and have the same issue
  - 2024-10-13 | I got it thank you
  - 2024-10-13 | Perfect thank you HAn
  - 2024-10-13 | I see what you're saying, the keywords with high impressions are the one I bid higher compared to the other
  - 2024-10-13 | 
  - 2024-10-13 | Means thoes keyword have no impression
  - 2024-10-13 | I just submitted a request for PPC assistance, and after reviewing the report for the last 15 days, I noticed that most of my keywords are not performing well. Only 2 or 3 keywords and product targeting have high impressions and a few sales since the launch. % ACOS is really high. Should I target new keywords? Thank you! ☺️
  - 2024-10-13 | Alright I see. Thank you

  - 2024-10-22 | Third Habit: Follow-Up Routine with Key Team Members and Suppliers
Before this change, I sometimes felt disconnected from my team and suppliers, and it was impacting my brand’s growth. So, I made it a habit to regularly check in with key team members and suppliers. Every Friday, I’d have a quick call or send an update to make sure everyone was aligned and things were running smoothly. It was like oiling the gears of a machine—those small conversations helped keep everything moving efficiently and strengthened the trust in my network.
The Result?
Over time, these small habits compounded. My business flourished, and for the first time, I found something even more precious: time. Time to spend with loved ones, time to explore new hobbies and even time to enjoy a quiet cup of coffee without feeling guilty.

And so, I discovered that success doesn’t have to come at the cost of everything else—it can come from small, consistent habits that lead to big growth.

Quick question: Have you applied this to your business and life yet? Comment below and let me know what you think
  - 2024-10-22 | “Success doesn’t come from one big move—it’s built from the small habits you practice every day.”
 Intrigued, I decided to try a new approach, focusing on building small, consistent habits.

First Habit: Daily Planning
Each morning, I took just five minutes to jot down the top three tasks that would have the biggest impact on my business. It was like planting seeds in a garden—small efforts, but with time and patience, they grew into big results. Suddenly, I wasn’t just busy; I was focused. No more endless to-do lists and overwhelming chaos—just three powerful actions to move the needle each day.

Second Habit: Batching Tasks
I used to jump from one task to another, putting out fires everywhere. But then, I decided to try something different: batching tasks. On Mondays, I dedicated the whole day to creating content—no meetings, no distractions, just pure creative flow. It was like getting in the zone, and the productivity was off the charts! Content creation became an easy, enjoyable rhythm instead of a constant source of stress.

lesson: *HACK* Save time with sourcing agent:

ABOUT THIS LESSON
If time isn't your friend, I highly recommend hiring a sourcing agent to help you do all the communication with manufacturers so that it saves you time and Fastrack your progress.

A sourcing agent will represent you to do all the groundwork and this allows you to focus on the most important task which is product development and planning your marketing plan. A sourcing agent can also help you get different products and bundle them together for your main product.

To conclude, getting a sourcing agent is the fastest way to save time. It's an investment for long-term scalability and time-saving.

  - 2024-11-13 | If you are constantly running out of time daily. I suggest to track how much time you spend on cooking, and clean up. Factor in your earning /h 

If 1session of : cooking + cleaning = 2hrs
You earn $30/h 
1 session would cost you $60+ food cost 

If mealprep service per meal is cheaper than your cost above then it make sense to mealprep to save time toward your business
  - 2024-11-13 | Quick question; anyone here try Cookunity meal prep before?

  - 2024-02-29 | New comers ALERT 🚨
Below is some important key points that will give you a higher chance to succeed in this journey.

1. Commiment: I know you guys have your life duties, but please commit to this journey and stay focus for the next 6 months.

2. Accountability: Keep yourself accountable, stay dedicated and put in the work required. Find an accountability partner will help as well. Remember, you're not in it alone, reach out for help when you face challenges.

3. Mindset: I wanna emphasize this is not an easy path. You willl for sure face a lot of challenges, roadblocks, and setbacks. But as long as you keep moving forward and don't quit, you'll find your way to success. Join Monday class with Shifu Charlie will help strengthening your mindset.

4. Stay Coachable: We can't teach people who don't have an open mind to learn new things. Once you get all the basic knowledge down, you can learn on your own all you want. But at first, listen to what we teach. My goal is to make you guys become more successful than me, so rest assure that I'll teach you everything I know as long as you listen.

---Thank you and let's get sh** done--

This sudden loss has left them unprepared both emotionally and financially as they were just newly college graduates and still have student loan debts.
Please join us in sending prayers and support to help her navigate this difficult time. Any prayer or contribution is genuinely appreciated.

  - 2024-07-26 | 📢 Important Announcement: Server Restructuring
Dear Shifu Members, @everyone 
Based on your feedback, we are making an effort to streamline support and simplify the community channels for our General members and Premium members. We have reorganized our community channels to better serve you, effective immediately.
What's Changing:
General Community Members: 🌐 You will continue to enjoy access to the general community channels. Please continue to use the “quick questions,” "casual chat," "daily journal," "shifu fitness," "shifu mindset," and other channels as you normally would. Team support will remain active but limited in these channels.
Premium Members: 🔹 You will notice that certain channels are now under a new category "Active Support". This reorganization will help our team stay organized and provide immediate and direct priority support within these channels. If your name is yellow, it means you are a Premium member.
Need Access or Have Questions? ❓ If you are a non-paying, General member who would like access to our active support channels, please contact our administrative support at ethel@amzshifu.com. We are here to help you make the most out of your experience in our community.
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. These changes will allow our team to focus and prioritize support questions for our paying members, significantly improving the support and resources available to you. We look forward to continuing to help you achieve your goals.
Best regards

  - 2024-01-30 | Dear Shifu family, @everyone 
It has been reported that some individuals are attempting to leverage the Amazon portal to solicit free products from sellers, in exchange for reviews. Please be aware that this practice is against Amazon's policy and could result in serious consequences for both parties involved, including account suspension.
⚠️ As a reminder, it's crucial that no mention of reviews, whether related to a request, an offer, or a negotiation, should be made through the Amazon portal. This includes all forms of communication - messages, customer support discussions, or any other interaction facilitated by Amazon.
  - 2024-01-30 | This is a new requirement under the transparency act. https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/boir/html .Who has a business entity needs to file this.
@everyone
  - 2024-11-15 | If you can(optional), start using a fresh new email for anything personal (bank, online shopping, gov, education, work, etc.)
And just use that compromised email for other stuff that you don't care about
  - 2024-11-15 | @everyone Quick tutorial
Use this site below to check if your data has been breached from compromised email.
https://haveibeenpwned.com/
Put in your email and hit Enter.
What if my email is compromised?
Scroll down it will show you the sites that breach your data -> go to those sites and delete your account>
After delete all the accounts, update your password and turn on 2FA.

  - 2024-10-26 | btw my friday night fun, working on improving PPC tool for yall
  - 2024-10-26 | the matte benz looks sick
  - 2024-10-21 | @everyone is ppc homework too difficult this week? Not many people submitted.
  - 2024-10-08 | We'll touch base on this
  - 2024-10-08 | I already monitor your launch bids they are good
  - 2024-10-07 | It's too late to increase price maybe next time, if you want to increase price do that 2 months before prime. 
But again, why do you have to do all that for just 2 days?
  - 2024-10-07 | The minimum discount for prime is 20% so depends on your margin you can decide to keep it 20% or give a but more
  - 2024-10-04 | just use your regular campaigns, don't need to change everything for just 2 days
  - 2024-10-04 | it does, you give amazon more money basically
  - 2024-09-29 | That's too high there must be something wrong
  - 2024-09-28 | I you do it, make sure you'll be profitable right at the beginning.
  - 2024-09-28 | But if I have to choose 1 to test it out, I'll go with page visits.
  - 2024-09-28 | well it entirely depends on your goal and your product performance.
And clearly it is not for new seller.
It's more for when you trying to grow your brand. As these campaigns won't give you product ranking
  - 2024-09-28 | these are Sponsored Brand campaigns
  - 2024-09-19 | if it's UPS, they will combine every box trackings into 1, go to that tracking you'll see a button "see $number box" it will show individual tracking of each box
  - 2024-09-15 | Yeah acknowledge it and next time remeber to put in the tracking number

  - 2024-10-28 | The tool gives you consistent logic while even for me, as a human, I can make bad decison on a bad day
  - 2024-10-28 | That's the purpose of ppc assistant. It'll give you what it thinks is good and you can decide.
If anything doesn't make sense then send it to me
  - 2024-10-24 | It's all relative, don't focus too much on the exact % but tryna pick up the pattern
  - 2024-10-24 | it wants to test more for that one since the spend is low

  - 2024-10-15 | it works for me I just scanned it
  - 2024-10-14 | Considering his followers it seems like a good deal but let's check
1. His engagement. Do his posts have consistent comments, share, like, etc
2. Audience: is his audiende your customers?
3. Reusable. If his video can be repurposed for other things it could be a good deal
4. Giving promotion for his followers is a must since why would they buy from you but not the competitors?
  - 2024-10-12 | what is the concern btw?
  - 2024-10-12 | can you screenshot each section?
  - 2024-10-12 | I can't see lol too blurry
  - 2024-10-11 | It mau be better if you screenshot the flow this is just what customers see
  - 2024-10-11 | give me 5 minutes
  - 2024-10-10 | lol noice
  - 2024-10-10 | please schedule a call with me
  - 2024-10-10 | it's ok, just not a luckly prime day for you I guess. Let's revisit in our call
  - 2024-10-10 | Hi Thao, saw your dm. Can you put your message here so all of us will aware?
  - 2024-10-17 | 1000 is a bit too much stay under 500. If neccessary you can skip box design first batch
  - 2024-10-14 | Composition: Lithium Ion
Regulation: Not applicable
  - 2024-10-14 | apply for GTIN exemption
  - 2024-10-10 | You can do it now no need waiting for supplier
  - 2024-10-10 | The goal is to see is there any requirements for that product
  - 2024-10-10 | And model number is basically what you decide it to be so it doesn't really matter
  - 2024-10-10 | Dummy listing doesn't need to be correct 100%
  - 2024-10-10 | done
  - 2024-11-11 | Well nothing wrong with negotiating for better price
  - 2024-11-11 | You have to keep up with returns if doing fbm
  - 2024-11-11 | And the volume is low so you can defo do that on your own
  - 2024-11-11 | I think for now you can try some fbm to get farmiliar with it before using a 3PL
  - 2024-11-07 | Also give that new one some time start slowly
  - 2024-11-07 | Slow it down focus on the one that works
  - 2024-11-05 | Hmm I thought you do pretty good? Are you tryna scale?
  - 2024-10-30 | well you can create all these on your own maybe with some help of a photographer/graphic designer
  - 2024-10-29 | well I have the same issue, we just gotta wait
  - 2024-10-22 | seems like meta is hating on you huh
  - 2024-10-22 | IG you only need an email
  - 2024-10-13 | search facebook verify
  - 2024-10-13 | make sure to verify your account this time
  - 2024-10-13 | usually just the page
  - 2024-10-13 | but getting your whole account banned is crazy
  - 2024-10-13 | just make it work while finding a better solution
  - 2024-10-13 | it's not that expensive just get one with no data
  - 2024-10-13 | may be or may be not, but it is a way
  - 2024-10-13 | ok then can you have a new phone number?
  - 2024-10-13 | create a new fb account, can you?
  - 2024-10-13 | stay compliant, election time is very sensitive
  - 2024-10-13 | ah that sucks
  - 2024-10-13 | did you spam the people in the chat?
  - 2024-10-13 | hmm that's weird what do you think that triggered the banned?
  - 2024-10-12 | using new facebook account to create page with bot will be a big red flag for facebook especially during election time
  - 2024-10-12 | just use your personal facebook account to create a page tho
  - 2024-10-12 | wait do you get the whole account banned or just the page?
  - 2024-10-12 | and connect that page to manychat
  - 2024-10-12 | but in the mean time just create a new fb page
  - 2024-10-12 | You can get it back by contacting meta support
  - 2024-11-13 | You can update tracking# yes
  - 2024-10-29 | this doesn't look like tracking ID but FBA ID
  - 2024-10-15 | usually Macy gives the best price
  - 2024-10-15 | that's probably not the final number just an estimate amount
  - 2024-10-14 | that looks correct
  - 2024-10-10 | should be ok, it's about the pace. Make it seems realistic
  - 2024-10-10 | Booking
https://api.leadconnectorhq.com/widget/booking/sZzWsC5MEcbtRRfgawqU?user_id=tvtAHbbVDvky72E3b3rr
  - 2024-10-10 | There may be some changes on manychat
  - 2024-10-10 | Let's save our time on dm by a quick call?
  - 2024-11-12 | Yeah it shouldn't be a big issue just don't repeat that too often
  - 2024-11-08 | you have to delete the listing and relist to update it
  - 2024-11-08 | there is but since you just launch let's not do it now
  - 2024-10-21 | yes
  - 2024-10-11 | smh
  - 2024-10-11 | what the hell is that
  - 2024-10-11 | former ghost writer in action
  - 2024-10-11 | I usually not really care if they leave bad review but since your brand is new let's not risk it lol
  - 2024-10-11 | ok so maybe just cut loss then lol
  - 2024-10-11 | lol
  - 2024-10-11 | 1 star amazon review?
  - 2024-10-11 | what can he do?
  - 2024-10-11 | but if you think the amount is not worth it then it's ok to cut loss but I don't like this guy based on what you provided
  - 2024-10-11 | not really, if you pay through paypal they will just withdraw his money if he can't prove that he fulfill the work
  - 2024-10-11 | gather all the email
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah let's dsipute it
  - 2024-10-11 | did you pay via "service" or "friend and family"
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah you can dispute it on paypal
  - 2024-10-11 | <@728408607510626444>  here
  - 2024-10-29 | your margin is already super low right now, I don't think dropping price is a good option
  - 2024-10-29 | result sent
  - 2024-10-29 | we can try to boost ppc but it may be very expensive
  - 2024-10-28 | I'm not mentioning anything about generating keywords
  - 2024-10-28 | go to the targeting tab on the campaign(where you see all the keywords) to download the csv
  - 2024-10-28 | no the sheet you used to submit the second form was wrong
  - 2024-10-25 | you have to go to where the keywords are to export
  - 2024-10-25 | for ppc assistant
  - 2024-10-25 | <@809813064756887582> the sheet in the second form you uploaded is not correct
  - 2024-10-23 | Looks good I'll send the result soon

  - 2024-10-15 | But well you can use the one Susan sent
  - 2024-10-15 | You have to duplicate it
  - 2024-10-15 | It'll be different for everyone instead use ppc tracker along with pppc assistant and practice with ppc homework
  - 2024-10-15 | And you don't need that sheet in the video there it's just to demonstrate the idea don't apply the formula
  - 2024-10-15 | It's not that one, find the ppc tracker video
  - 2024-10-14 | No we reconstructed the channels. It should be on shifu vault tho

  - 2024-10-13 | then send the link here
  - 2024-10-13 | ok it's been 10 days, you can do ppc tracking
  - 2024-10-13 | I think she's asking since what day you launch?
  - 2024-10-13 | it means amazon can bid higher that what you put in up to 2x the amount
  - 2024-10-13 | nah not really
  - 2024-10-13 | yeah go to exact campaign under campaign setting you can switch it to fixed bid
  - 2024-10-13 | th exact need to be fixed bid not sure why it's up and down weird
  - 2024-10-13 | The ultimate is correct
  - 2024-10-13 | which ones are they?
  - 2024-10-13 | huh that's weird it shouldn't be bid up and down
  - 2024-10-12 | I remember I didn't set your auto camp that low

  - 2024-11-04 | Reach out to us and give me some weekly activities to keep you accountable
  - 2024-10-28 | but you can consult with Justin on this to see what's his opinion is
  - 2024-10-28 | Since it's your first product, I'm leaning toward the later. Take a bit more time to find a better market with less restriction while building up your experience with Amazon
  - 2024-10-28 | on the other hand, staying away from this market can save you a lot of headache later down the road
  - 2024-10-28 | It's a bit hard to give the right answer in this case, as moving forward with that supplier inherit some risk, but of course it'll continue your progress with less disruption
  - 2024-10-21 | They had a system glitch a few dys ago
  - 2024-10-21 | Let's open an appeal under account health

  - 2024-11-15 | ah ok not much
  - 2024-11-15 | remind me about that I'll do it during class
  - 2024-11-15 | check your keyword ranking using helium10 listing analizer (I may need to do a tutorial)

1. Look at ppc homework 1 and do about 20-50 keywords
2. Compare with the result
3. If you don't get most of it right -> use ppc assistant as your optimization tool while you're practice more
  - 2024-10-30 | also, navigate to homeowork and do Data visibility homework and send that to me as well
  - 2024-10-30 | can you watch ppc tracker and fill that out and send it to me?

  - 2024-11-15 | let's delete and do it again this time send me screenshot of the sheet first before uploading
  - 2024-11-15 | also did you mark Update under Update/Delete column?
  - 2024-11-15 | don't fill the whole thing
  - 2024-11-15 | just fill out the red outlined ones
  - 2024-11-15 | usually we don't need to fill out the inventory part
  - 2024-11-13 | and upload the file
  - 2024-11-13 | wait at least 24 hours
  - 2024-11-13 | then delete it
  - 2024-11-13 | then take some screenshot from the listing jsut in case
  - 2024-11-13 | it's safe to download and fill out the sheet first make sure everything correct
  - 2024-11-13 | ok then back to the deleting and reuploading method
  - 2024-11-13 | that's why I'm asking do you have to use that one
  - 2024-11-13 | then you must use the same ASIN then
  - 2024-11-13 | if it's still the same ASIN then it's not gonna work
  - 2024-11-13 | you can tryI'm not sure what you mean by copy
  - 2024-11-13 | it's much easier that way
  - 2024-11-13 | well then just create a new one if you haven't done anything with that old one
  - 2024-11-13 | you're not selling on that listing right
  - 2024-11-13 | no need to delete you can just leave it there
  - 2024-11-13 | then just create a new one tho
  - 2024-11-13 | do you HAVE TO use that same listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | that sheet is tricky lmk if you got stuck
  - 2024-11-13 | fill the ones outlined in red color
  - 2024-11-13 | anything that has the arrow must be picked not typed in
  - 2024-11-13 | fill out the template: you must use Microsoft Excel for this
  - 2024-11-13 | download the template in Catalog -> Upload via file -> Download template
  - 2024-11-13 | do what I suggest, screenshot all the detail inside your listing first

  - 2024-11-11 | Hi! This is my first post after my intro post and excited to be a part of this amazing community!         
3 goals for this week: Finish modules for week 1, start getting on the product research modules, finding an accountability partner as I start this journey! 

To be accomplished by Friday! 

None so far, I will ask questions as they come up 

Have a great week everyone!!
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi everyone! excited to meet you all!!  I am Charmine Di Turi. I am currently 28 years old and just moved to the US 5 months ago. I am working in the hospitality industry. I am starting my Amazon Shifu mentorship journey today, November 9th, and I will succeed in this. Succeeding in this program means that I am able to make money passively, not live paycheck to paycheck, make myself proud, but most importantly pay it forward. I am excited to be a part of this community as I've seen the impact this program has given a lot of people- not just financially but their overall mindset in life. 1% greater everyday. I am so motivated to succeed because I believe I am in a place to help others and change lives. May not be many but I definitely want to create a greater impact. I am doing this for myself, my future children, my husband, those in need. I want to show them that hard-work pays off and life is meant to be enjoyed. We should be our own bosses and live our lives in our own terms. I want to be able to start a family and to travel. I do not want to be where I'm at- working 12-14 hour days and having only a day a week to spend with my husband. I want to be in control of my time. In the future, when I’m successful- I want to tell myself that Hard-work pays off and anything is possible. When encountering difficulty I will remind myself that:  Struggling is normal. If I give up now- I will be in the same situation for the rest of my life.  https://youtu.be/kwX118LM8vE
  - 2024-11-13 | nope- but been meaning to try it out! Do you recommend it?
  - 2024-11-12 | Jan! After the 12th preferably as I will be in the Ph until the 11th 😅

  - 2024-11-15 | Ok! you should have it in your inbox in about 10 minutes
  - 2024-11-15 | Should I dM you this info or email?
  - 2024-11-15 | Yes I paid them. Everything is in motion with trademark. I applied for my brand regsitry and was declined. Do you think it was because one of my storefront was deactivated at that time? And I have to wait for brand approval before I create the listing and get the FNSKU for my product, is that correct?
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Minh. From what I understand the application takes up to 18 months for full approval. The Attorney didn't see any challenges with our trademark and have submitted the application for trademark. Attorney said to wait 10 days to apply for brand in which I did. I think at the time I applied for the brand, my canada store was deactivated due to no activity. Canada is now ative again and I submitted an appeal 2 days ago.
  - 2024-11-15 | Hello - Question about brand registry and when to create the listing to obtain the FNSKU. Are we supposed to wait for brand approval before creating the listing? I thought we were supposed to wait - but I went back to module 2 and in part 3 it said we need to take photos of our package with the FNSKU already on there and include it with the brand application. Please advise. Just started production and hopefully I can get this squared away soon.🫤
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you Minh!

  - 2024-11-15 | Hi Tanner. Did you ever find out the ansewr to your question? I'm in the same boat now and just search FNSKU and found your post. TIA
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you!
  - 2024-10-26 | Thank you, Susan! 🙂
  - 2024-10-26 | Would love some feedback on the FNSKU barcode. Do you prefer it to be included on the packaging design? Or Labels to be added later by the supplier?
  - 2024-10-26 | Any insight on this would be helpful. TIA!
  - 2024-10-26 | Ok this is weird. I haven't done product analyzing lately and had to sign back in with Helium. Now when I click on the analyze product, it takes me to a totally different chart. It doesn't show the total rev for that product for the last 30 days. It shows inluencer commisions, influencer videos, avergage commissions.... what am I doing wrong? I can't figure it out and It's driving me cray. 😅

  - 2024-10-28 | Hello! To get the FNKSU barcode, should I create the code using the sample listing I created before? Or create a new listing of the actual product I am selling then create the FNSKU?
  - 2024-10-23 | Can you please remind me I have one free session with Justin to go over the product selected, is that correct? Should I scheudle the call with him now? We are about to design packaing for this product and place bulk order when completed.
  - 2024-10-23 | Sorry their description wasn't clear. They said we don;t need packaging details until 8-12 months after application has been submitted.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is this the order I should be taking? Or do I need to go ahead and place the bulk order now to get the photos?
  - 2024-10-16 | I was waiting for the trademark to get approved first before I design the packaging to be send to the supplier and then order the builk order.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hi! I;m a little confused and just about to start the tradmark process. One of the attorneys list of itmes needed is a photo of our logo on the package. I thought this wasn't needed until we start the brand registry.

  - 2024-10-30 | Yup. There is no limit to the imagination
  - 2024-10-30 | Hmmmm. runway is like Midjourney but videos. Very cool!
  - 2024-10-30 | Thank you!!!
  - 2024-10-30 | cool. will def look into it
  - 2024-10-30 | Yes, share Runway pls. thanks
  - 2024-10-30 | I'll look into Runway. Yes, I have been using Canva. I am also using Midjourney but not for AMZ. I mainly use it to generate photos for digital art to sell in etsy. I think they have a new update where you can add stuff on your photo. I have not tried it yet but they have been saying that it is better than Photoshop AI. maybe someone has tried Midjourney's new feature?
  - 2024-10-30 | yes, I wanna follow this thread. I have been watching youtube videos about ads using AI.

  - 2024-11-15 | Cool! I am leaving FBM open and  left 1 stock hoping someone will purchase as I have 1 returned unit left in the warehouse. 😅 Did you do an MCF on that order or did you have the stock with u?
  - 2024-11-15 | Yes, I am making a bigger profit. My FBA is 69.99, FBM is 99.99. Someone actually purchased it for that amount!! 😄
  - 2024-11-15 | I will fulfil the order via MCF then. Thanks Shifu Justin.
  - 2024-11-15 | SHelp. Someone bought from my FBM, just using it for my FBM reviews. I still have 2 returned stocks available in FBA. Is there a way to send my FBA stock using MCF to fulfil my FBM order? Or should I just contact the buyer and let them know that I am out of stock and cancel that order?
  - 2024-11-13 | All good. Will do that. Thanks Chloe.
  - 2024-11-07 | What? How'd you do it? Tutorial for dummy please. Ahahaha. I just contact amazon (not as seller) and ask for refund?
  - 2024-11-07 | I had 1 that was an MCF to an AMZ influencer. It was lost in transit. I contacted amazon and they said they will refund as soon as I give them the proof that I sent the buyer/influencer a refund. I told them why should I send the influencer a refund when it was a free item. We just went round and round and it was frustrating. There is no way to contact the shipping company used by Amz as well. So I just gave up. 😵‍💫
  - 2024-11-06 | Ok will do. Thanks
  - 2024-11-05 | I just got a notification that it will be relisted in 7days. I extended it to 30days. Is that correct?
  - 2024-10-29 | so it just stays in the warehouse until new stocks arrive?
  - 2024-10-29 | If I have a return that qualifies for restock, do I just turn on my listing then close it after it gets sold?

  - 2024-04-25 | Thank you Shifu <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-04-25 | I already got my business name. Question: Do I place ***"Business name" Pty Ltd*** as my Amazon store or I can just use the business name without Pty Ltd?
  - 2024-10-23 | Ok. Thanks Susan.
  - 2024-10-23 | Will it make a difference on relaunch if I slow down my sales? Lower my PPC bids? I will still be sold out before the 2nd batch arrives.
  - 2024-10-08 | Got it! Thanks for A++ advice. 😊
  - 2024-10-08 | I am running out of budget on 2 of my campaigns, I have increased it and still running out. Do u suggest increasing still? I have 14 sales since prime day started.
  - 2024-10-07 | Ok. Like right now, with the price I am selling. I have 30% profit margjn. If I give 20% off it would be around 20% profit margin. Do you recommend increasing the price a little bit so when you do a 20% discount, the profit margin would be around 25%?
  - 2024-10-06 | When doing prime sales, how much profit margin are you guys willing to go down to?
  - 2024-09-29 | the one that looks like this?
  - 2024-09-29 | ok. thanks Engel. Do you have a link to the PPC optimization sheet?
  - 2024-09-29 | +ppc optimization sheet. Or is there a place where it is stored and we can just download it?
  - 2024-09-29 | Can I have the link to the ppc tracking sheet pls
  - 2024-09-22 | Hi <@536075832658231299> and <@1066465177140215928> . I have sent you a DM. Please check. Thanks
  - 2024-09-19 | photos sent via DM. Thanks Shifu.
  - 2024-09-15 | I have 2 more shipping boxes coming in. I am crossing my fingers that I won't get a notification.
  - 2024-09-15 | Was that with Elinor as well?
  - 2024-09-15 | There is only a reference number which I could not place in. So next time, I will not be getting their services again. 😵‍💫
  - 2024-09-15 | The issue was, the shipping company cannot provide me a tracking number. this is from the shipping agent, Elinor -->Hello Tricia, cause we will deliver them by truck, there isn't tracking number for it.
  - 2024-11-12 | I am in this stage now. I changed my add-ons to a totally different ones so part my unboxing videos will be edited out. If you have to choose one, do the product feature instead of unboxing. And add an unboxing video when you have your new design. Hope that helps.
  - 2024-11-08 | I hope they expand and can let people with overseas business account connect with their US account.
  - 2024-11-08 | Hi <@1066465177140215928> . I have listened to yesterday's class. You were talking about tiktok shop. I have been looking into this as well. It is very promising. Have you connected your tiktok shop to your amz accout already so it automatically does the MCF order? Also, is there a way for overseas people to open tiktok shop? There are a lot of requirements like SS, EIN and LLC, which I don't have.
  - 2024-10-28 | <@1172937966855917613>
  - 2024-10-25 | Ok. Got it. Will do. Thanks Shifu.
  - 2024-10-25 | ahahaha. they sound dodgy though. that is all they say. hi or hello and do not reply back. when you receive a message it says you need to reply within 24hours. just listening to module 6, vid 6. Charlie is saying you need to reply otherwise it will affect your account if you don't respond timely.
  - 2024-10-25 | I have almost 10 people messaging me in seller central. they just either say hi or hello. not a question about a product. I have replied asking them if they have any questions about the product but they don't reply back. what is up with that? ideas? or are these your competitors trying to lower your rating if you don't reply within 24hours?

  - 2024-11-11 | My Name is Jenn O. and I am a photographer, videographer and run a photobooth business. I live in Los Angeles CA and my hobbies are going to music festivals, being outdoors in nature, trying new things, exploring food and traveling the world. 

My vision for my life is to be have financial stability and ultimately be able to experience life with the people I love since I never had that growing up. My current position in the service industry is taking away the opportunity for me to make money while I’m not there. I’m committed to diversifying my income so that I can provide stability for my future. Also I want to be able to provide stability and peace for my mother who is getting old in korea and I want to be able to give back 10 folds. 

My goals in the next 1-2 years is to have my first amazon shop set up or even two! Also to move my home office for photography into studio/warehouse in 1 year. Also another big goal in 2 years is to have saved enough money for a house.

What I would tell my future self when I am successful and looking back at my journey is that I am proud of you for sticking to your commitment and vision. I’m proud that you stayed consistent, trusted the process and made the necessary sacrifices to be where you are today.

What I would tell myself when I am encountering difficulty so I don’t give up is that it’s okay to not know everything and that there is support around me if I ask. Also not to regret letting more time pass by cause my younger self deserve to have what I’ve always envisioned for me!
  - 2023-11-26 | TEAM SHIFU STAND UP! 🙌🏽
Have fun and be safe out there! 🙏🏽
  - 2024-11-12 | Jan. But Feb would be even better after all the holidays

  - 2024-11-06 | 3 goals: 
- Slight chance of plan to the potential product. I have scheduled a talk with Minh to see if the plan is appropriate. Meeting is on Thursday.
- Revisit previous product to refresh my memory on the data. This will be done today.
- If everything goes well and I decide to go back to previous product, have the listing approved by Amazon by EOW.
  - 2024-11-04 | Goal 1: test out all competitors’ products from Amazon. By EOW
Goal 2: finish ordering samples from 3-4 other suppliers. By EOW
Goal 3: readjust Manychat flow from previous product to this new potential product 🙂 by Wednesday
  - 2024-11-02 | Past week: I was able to order 2 samples from one of my suppliers by yesterday. I planned to order from 4 suppliers, but some of them took a little while to come back with appropriate quotes. 

Solution: I scheduled a couple business video call with the suppliers next week so that we can go over the details more efficiently.

My goals for next week:
1. Test out products from best sellers and other growing new sellers.
2. Order sample from 4 other suppliers.
3. Customize the user manual for my product based on my competitor’s user manual with my brand name on it 🤗
  - 2024-10-30 | I’m about to go to bed after my 12 hr shift but let’s gooo! 

Top 3 goals:
- Communicate with suppliers and choose out top 5 suppliers to order samples from by the end of Friday.
- Checking with shipping agents to see if they can offer me better shipping quote since each of my product will be around 5-6lbs - by the end of Friday.
- Order 5-7 products from my competitors on Amazon to test the quality of their products by the end of Thursday.

Support needed: 🙏🙏
- Anyone got any tips on finding freight forwarder that can offer me better pricing? I aware that Macy is our trusted agent but would like to branch out further!
  - 2024-10-29 | Thank you big sis! I'm still currently product researching now and found a potential product already 🫣 Hopefully it can be approve by anh Minh 😄
  - 2024-10-28 | I'm a little bit down as after doing all the trade mark, all the sample orderings, creating manuals, e-books, and designs for my first product within the past 2 months that I found out my product is FDA restricted that potentially posed many challenges down the road 😢 After some serious considerations, I'm moving away from this product and back to product research to find a new one. My goals for the upcoming week are: doing at least 2 hours of product research everyday, creating and vetting the dummy listing to prevent us running into problems in the future, communicating with potential suppliers to get the best price for the upcoming product, and ensuring profit calculation sheet that I'm profitable with this upcoming product. 😄

  - 2024-11-11 | awesome. Will send you soon!
  - 2024-11-11 | Question about product research: When I search certain terms for a product, I get really good result for it as a potential product for me to pursue with 10-12 non-US/AMZ new sellers are doing well above $15k/month. But when I start searching for the product's generic name, I start to see 1-2 US sellers (with less than 200 reviews) that are doing well ($50-100k/month) popping up. What is the expert advise on this? Should I pursue further on this product?

  - 2024-10-28 | Another issue when it comes to starting all over again is that I have already submitted my trademark application 🥲 This is the most costly thing I have done so far and trying to find a new product to fit under this name brand would also be a challenge.
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you <@536075832658231299> for your advice! I appreciate it!  I can see the risk of having just one supplier for your product. If anything goes wrong, I won’t be having a backup supplier.

<@975774205658411068> Hey shifu, would you be able to provide me with your thoughts on my situation? If both of you and Han lean toward the latter, I will drop the product. 

Thank you for all your help
  - 2024-10-28 | (2) Sourcing Agents: I have reached out to Macy and Elinor last week to help me source a product that has FDA 501k clearance. Thus far, Macy has not been able to locate a supplier that can offer better deal that the one I have right now. Furthermore, Macy said no other supplier can provide similar product with the FDA 501k clearance as it is difficult to obtain the certification from the FDA.

My questions are:

1. Should I move forward with this product and order the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier?
2. If “no” is the answer to the first question, what would be recommended for the next step? Should I move away from this product? 

Thank you for all your help! I hope to hear from you soon!
  - 2024-10-28 | Hi Shifu team,

I hope you all had a great weekend! 😆

I’m sending out this message to update you on my listing issue prior to placing a bulk order. I’m asking for advices on if I should go ahead and purchase the FDA 501(k) clearance from our supplier so I can test out the listing?

Recap: My product is an “Abdominal Electrical Muscle Stimulator Belt” that requires an FDA 501(k) certification to seller in the US and on Amazon. I have done extensive research on this matter and confirmed that I will need the FDA 501(k) in order to sell this product to the public as Amazon has categorized this product as a medical device. Up to now, I have resolved all the other problems on the dummy listing except for submitting the FDA 501(k) certification from my supplier to Seller Support Central

(1) Negotiation with supplier for FDA 501(k) certification: In the beginning,  my suppler wanted 50% down payment of the bulk order in order for me to obtain the FDA 501(k) clearance number to test out my listing. After a few days of negotiation, I was able to bring the price down to 30% down payment for the bulk order (which is roughly $2,500), and the supplier will not take anything less than that for the FDA 501k number. Note: This supplier owns the pattern of a product that has been selling on Amazon by another Chinese seller, and the supplier has assured me that the other Chinese seller was able to submit the same FDA 501(k) clearance number and they are currently selling the product on Amazon.
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you so much <@1054411267340763216> <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you and have a blessed day!
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi Shifu team, would anyone be able to share the sourcing agent Macy that Shifu Justin talked about? I would like to see if they can help me with sourcing out a product! 🙏
  - 2024-10-21 | I did. I’ll continue to follow up with them daily
  - 2024-10-21 | In your experience, would it be worth it to continue with this product since they require a lot of paper work and certification? Thanks
  - 2024-10-21 | UPDATE: The new listing became inactive right when I submitted it. I’m reading up on the regulation on the FDA regarding Electrical Muscle Stimulator. They said that this device will require 501k certification from FDA. I will have to wait for Amazon to response and then will go from there.
  - 2024-10-21 | I will try to create another listing without using any sensitive wording again to see how it goes.
  - 2024-10-21 | Yes, I did try to stay away from sensitive wording and my dummy listing has been approved for over 4-6 weeks, but just 2 days ago, Amazon Seller Central just made my listing inactive. I talked to my supplier about this issue and how one of my competitor was able to have the listing posted since they had the same model as my product. She said they were approved as they submitted further clarification paperwork and also the 501K FDA certification fromthe supplier.
  - 2024-10-19 | Here is my product: EMS belt and arm bands
  - 2024-10-19 | They said my product is for medical professional use only. But not for the public. I believe that is not true that i was able to purchase them myself. Nevertheless, i have submitted an appeal with picture of the packaging and the manual as stated in here. However, my supplier would only send me their 501k number from the FDA for their product once I placed a bulk order, and every supplier has said the same thing to me. I will wait for Amazon to respond then negotiate with my supplier that i want to order from them but it’s unreasonable to place a bulk order since i cant even sell it on amazon. I’m considering offering to put down a 3-5% deposit as good faith for the 501k number from the FDA. Would you think this approach is appropriate? <@536075832658231299> thanks for helping!
  - 2024-10-19 | Actually nevermind, all of my dummy listings have gone inactive. I’ll chat further with Amazon to see how I can have it resolved. Would you recommend going with services on Fiverr to help resolve this problem? Thanks
  - 2024-10-19 | Hi anh <@1054411267340763216> thank you for answering my question about the UPC code vs the FNSKU on the dummy listing. Even after I use the service on Fiverr to convert the dummy listing to the real listing, would Amazon potentially flag me for having the product still in the restricted category? 😬
  - 2024-10-17 | I'm on it 😄
  - 2024-10-17 | And just now 1 hour later Amazon approved my brand 🥳
  - 2024-10-17 | Quick update: My supplier finished the logo-embedded product early. Just submitted Brand Registry application! ✅🙌🙌
  - 2024-10-15 | Such a productive call! Thank you Anh Minh! 🙌
  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks anh Minh! Booked a session for tomorrow! 🙌
  - 2024-10-13 | While I was waiting for the ball to roll, I have finished the following:
- Two customized manuals for my main product and my add-on product ✅
- Insert card ✅
- 2 E-books as free gift for customers to leave review! ✅
- Instagram and Facebook page for my brand ✅
- Website Domain ✅
- Facebook Many Chat Flow to ask for reviews ✅ maybe I need to do one for IG as well since many of my friends are more active on IG? 

What other suggestions would the team recommend? 

I couldn’t thank you enough for the great content and support for the past two months. I learned a lot and still have a long way to go 🙌
I owe you guys each a bowl of Pho when you come to San Jose hehe 🥳
  - 2024-10-13 | My to do list:
- Brand Registry: By the end of next week or the beginning of the week after that, I should be able to do brand registry. I will rewatch the videos in this module to refresh my knowledge. 
- Final Pricing Sheet with Supplier: I’m currently working this as well as trying to as for further discount as everything is set in place for now. 
- Barebones Listing: After Brand Registry is done, I will work on Barebones Listing to grab the FNSKU code you place it on the final packaging box. 
- Schedule a call with anh <@1054411267340763216> to go over the details (the market, my offers, pricing sheet, the contract with my supplier) before I place a bulk order. 
- Listing Creation: after all the above is done, i’ll reach out to Susan for Listing creation. <@1066465177140215928> Please let me know your pricing so I can prepare ahead of time 😁

Is this plan sounded to the team? 😃
<@1054411267340763216> I would love to have the contract template ao I can start preparing it if you can share that with me 😁
  - 2024-10-13 | Quick recap on what i have done up to date:
- Trademark for my brand was filed Oct 3rd. After that I have my designer had been customizing my packaging and product with my brand logo on them.
- By the end of last week, I have just received my final design for the packaging box and on my product from the designer 
- I sent the design to my supplier and they will start making a sample with my logo on it (which takes about a week or so) for me to apply for brand registry.
  - 2024-10-13 | Thank you <@1066465177140215928> and <@1054411267340763216> for reaching out to me 😁 I just finished work and heading into church now! I will update you shortly later about my current progress! 🙌
  - 2024-10-29 | Daily too 2: 
1. Hop on PR class with Minh and present my potential product.
2. If approved, start ordering samples. If not, PR another 10 products today!
  - 2024-11-13 | Omg this is so useful sis! Thank you for sharing!

This week, I actively worked on developing my brand across various platforms using a trial-and-error method to maximize brand exposure and increase its recognition.

I registered on Twitter and opted for a paid subscription to get the 🔷️ blue Verified checkmark, which confirms the brand's reliability. This allowed me to comment on posts and like content on behalf of the brand, contributing to building trust. Within two days, I gained 20 organic followers on my channel.

On YouTube, I created a business account for free. The platform provides a studio where you can use artificial intelligence to create and enhance posts, write code, and apply hashtags for organic audience growth. Additionally, I included links to social media, Amazon, the website, and other important resources, helping to centralize brand information and expand reach.

I also registered on Linktr.ee, which serves as a brand portfolio. This free service allows you to place all links to social networks and product platforms, acting as a digital business card. The ease of setup and functionality make Linktr.ee an excellent option for our brand, and I definitely recommend it to our students.

Moreover, I started using Blogger.com to create a mini-website for the brand. This free resource allows you to create a fully functional page within a few days, adding photos, videos, detailed product descriptions, and embedded links to Amazon and social media. After three days of work, I achieved excellent results.

Overall, I highly recommend the platforms Twitter, YouTube, Linktr.ee, and Blogger.com as effective and simple solutions for expanding digital marketing and enhancing the brand’s online presence. 💜

  - 2024-10-30 | The world of AI is evolving rapidly, with so many programs, platforms, and websites available that it can be easy to get lost. To avoid spending money in vain, it’s essential to explore carefully and choose something that truly supports your specific business needs. It’s like picking a car: some people need a large family model, others prefer a nimble sports car, and some just want something small and economical. The key is to find what works best for you, and then AI becomes a powerful assistant, not just an expensive accessory!
Runway easy to used, GPT chat will help  with something in 1 step, how to write Prompt, but our brain more better for that.
  - 2024-10-30 | I follow in love with AI so badly,  but it's so challenge  for me because everything English.  Great start with Canva and After is Runway. Better to buy unlimited, they just bring new future tools and it's just sick good. Alot free tutorials on YouTube,  also Runway have Discord i can share if someone needs.

  - 2024-10-25 | One- and two-star reviews are like the little villains every hero faces; it means you’re on the right track and scaring the competition! They’re trying to pull a ‘Lex Luthor’ move, throwing shade because they can’t keep up with your superhero level.
But we know who the real Wonder Woman here is: it’s you! Keep your shield up, stay focused, and remember you’ve got a whole team of superhero Shifu cheering you on! These little obstacles only prove that you’re on the path to something great. 💜💜💜

  - 2024-11-12 | 8. My last tips. With the holidays and Christmas approaching, every buyer wants their purchase to look giftable. So I send products to influencers in Christmas gift packaging and include instructions to make the video more engaging, with an emphasis on the product’s giftable presentation. This is my personal preference — for the product to look attractive and eye-catching in the ads.
  - 2024-11-12 | After working with influencers for two months and communicating with them, I can share my experience. By sending emails and direct messages to accounts and communicating with over a hundred people, I saw the mistakes I made. I want to share the tips that helped me now and that may be useful for those working with influencers in this field to understand the strategy that worked for me, based on my own mistakes.

1. I realized that when you approach influencers as a brand founder, it often leads to higher pricing. This is very similar to the experience with suppliers in China. When you mention that you have a boss and are just an employee, they begin to behave differently, more grounded. Experience has shown that influencers are people just like me, and they also want to earn money. However, they respond more humanely if they know I’m an employee and need my boss’s approval on the price.


2. While reviewing and studying each influencer’s page, I noticed that many of them are already part of the Amazon Affiliate program, which allows them to create links to products for promotion and receive commissions on each sale. However, many influencers I spoke with were either unaware of this program or thought that joining was very difficult. So, I prepared a step-by-step presentation for them on how to register for this program. If any students need this information, I can share it. The presentation is in English, and in it, I outlined the earning potential, the opportunities Amazon offers, and that the Amazon Affiliate program is entirely free for influencers. This also shows influencers that we are committed to a trusted partnership by providing full instructions for proper registration.


3. After registering in the Amazon Affiliate program and accessing the Site Stripe dashboard, influencers can see how many purchases were made via the link they placed in their content. In the contract between influencers and the brand, I added a recommendation to register platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok. This will help them earn more and develop their content.


4. Amazon Attribution is a very user-friendly program. The 10% bonus is applied as a reduction on your referral fees and bonus program for your Influencers. 
Creating campaigns in it is also straightforward. However, there are a few important points to consider when creating links. You need to go to Seller Central > Advertising > Campaign Manager and select Amazon Ads. Next, you should click on "Measurement Reporting" — this will take us to the Amazon Attribution page, where you can create an ad campaign (click "Create Campaign"). It’s fairly easy to fill out, but I recommend using the manual mode for greater accuracy. Also, it’s essential to correctly copy the link to your Amazon listing: you don’t need to paste the entire link with keywords — just end it with the ASIN and the "/" symbol. This link is entered in the URL field of the campaign and group you create. Save the changes at the top and create the campaign.
5. Only after creating the campaign and subgroup will you see Attribution Tags on the dashboard for each campaign group. These long Attribution Tags are used to place ads on influencer pages, as well as on your pages and in content where you will be advertising and tracking data.
6. If you’re creating a campaign with 1 to 5 groups (for example, for 5 influencers, each requiring a separate link), I recommend naming each group after the respective influencer. This will help you know exactly which influencers are making the most impact on your sales. You can also record the date they posted your ad, making it easier to provide data and calculate bonus commissions on their sales.
7. For convenience, I created a Word document where I save all Attribution links for each piece of content: Instagram, Facebook, website, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter. Each group is labeled with the influencer’s name, so I have quick access to information and a more organized process.

  - 2024-10-24 | <@1234449316941271070> I grew up in Cleveland and went to Ohio State, glad to see a fellow Ohioan 🙂  Welcome to the community!
  - 2024-10-10 | <@536075832658231299> <@1054411267340763216> <@1066465177140215928> 
All - I would like to provide an update regarding <@1263229562142330913>who is currently under financial distress due to unexpected personal circumstances. I met with him tonight to discuss the status of his membership and we've decided to put him on pause as he wish to remain in the program. I have a follow-up meeting to check-in with him regarding his situation and reassess his status a month from now on Wed 11/6. I've informed him to reach out to us through this dedicated private channel if his situation improves and we can resume active support for him.

<@1263229562142330913> We will be praying for you brother and please do not hesitate to reach out to our team through this chat if you need anything. Please keep us updated, will check up on you and your family in a month.
  - 2024-11-15 | Jamie can help coordinate the effort within the team and you can continue to provide feedback
  - 2024-11-15 | <@308107877493768193> This looks good, I think we need to start assigning owners within the team to help take your feedback and make the updates, can you add a priority colunn of High, Medium, Low? I think that'll help give us an idea on what updates are truly important or urgent, if it's a minor thing but a nice to have update, I would mark those as Low
  - 2024-11-07 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-07 | Just wanted to give you a heads up and some background
  - 2024-11-07 | I would wait for her to reach out
  - 2024-11-07 | @everyone Team - please make note of her goals, I will let you know if her payment clears and is officially extended
  - 2024-11-07 | I would hate for her to pull back as her membership officially expires in 10 days or so with the progress she has made thus far
  - 2024-11-07 | I am sending her a payment link, she's committed and only has good things to say about the team and program, please help encourage her extension, we will take care of her
  - 2024-11-07 | <@308107877493768193> Heads-up, I had a retention / extension call with Carolina Chu, she agrees to pay the extension with the Continuation offer, it's $2k for 6 months + one bonus month so a total of 7 months, her first milestone is to hit $1k profit in 6 months and $2-3k profit over the next 12 months, so it's totally realistic and feasible for us to help her hit those goals and even exceed them, but she wanted to talk to you about her progress as she has a close connection with you from the beginning
  - 2024-11-06 | No worries brother, it's been a crazy past week for most, just wanted to check-in
  - 2024-11-06 | Hi <@308107877493768193>, how is the course content assessment coming along? Anything you need from us at the moment?
  - 2024-10-30 | <@1059659092475531444> FYI - Met with Louis, he'll be helping out with content management and will perform an audit on what is out-dated or needs improving, he'll reach out for your support to divide and conquer once he puts together a plan
  - 2024-10-30 | <@308107877493768193> Looks good, I just sent it over to Justin, thanks!
  - 2024-10-30 | <@308107877493768193> Would you be able to create a version of the Daily SOP for distribution? Removing the version control and etc? That way we can upload the document in the vault for people to download...
  - 2024-10-30 | Appreciate that <@308107877493768193> it was brought to our attention, let's make sure he's taken cared of
  - 2024-10-29 | Thanks <@308107877493768193> sent you an invite for 12:30pm PST, hope that's ok
  - 2024-10-28 | <@308107877493768193> thanks! What’s a good time Wednesday and I’ll check my calendar
  - 2024-10-28 | <@308107877493768193> what is your schedule like this week? Would like to meet and get your input on some offers that are being developed…
  - 2024-10-28 | Ok thanks, let me know if you're limited on Loom, we can work on getting you a paid account
  - 2024-10-28 | <@308107877493768193> Do you use Loom? Would you be able to create a video that walks through the Daily SOP and how to implement it? We can send the recording over to Justin and he can decide whether to re-record it in his voice or end up using your video, let me know if there are any concerns or questions
  - 2024-10-24 | @everyone FYI - I've created the "my-daily-top2s" channel in the general community but only moderators and admins can see it now, when ready we'll add the general and premium members to it for visibility but it's there now
  - 2024-10-24 | Module 1 - Part 2 is Product Analysis so that covers the analysis sheet prepation as the entire module covers all of that and how to request a review
  - 2024-10-24 | The lesson is titled "Product Research Tracker tool"
  - 2024-10-24 | <@308107877493768193> We have separate modules regarding the product tracking sheet but they all should be in the Product Research module
  - 2024-10-23 | We can do a final review before we go live with everything
  - 2024-10-23 | Yes it’ll be under product research module
  - 2024-10-23 | A lot of it was redundant and there will be a new lesson under product research called “How to submit your product analysis request”
  - 2024-10-23 | <@308107877493768193> It has been replaced, it’s now in the vault but not yet published
  - 2024-10-23 | Minh is drafting some of the old syllabus stuff into the vault right now, once that is done we can sunset all those assets and rely solely on the vault for information going forward, I can work with you to get the final version of the SOP added to the vault so the student can download and begin using it
  - 2024-10-23 | <@308107877493768193> Also, let's go ahead and add the Daily Top 2s concept into the SOP,  if you need a short description, the purpose of the Top 2 is to build a simple habit of keeping yourself accountable to complete the top 2 priorities for the day that you must realistically can get done, it can be anything (e.g. watch 2 lessons, attend class, reach out to 5 suppliers, 2 hours of product research, create product listing, setup AMZ account, etc.) - you get the idea
  - 2024-10-23 | <@308107877493768193> During my meeting with Minh on orientation, we found this in the syllabus for product research, any chance you can integrate some of these daily actions into the SOP?

  - 2024-10-26 | @everyone I just met with Jose, he's committed but going through some challenges with a demanding work schedule (10-14 hours a day, multiple facilities), his schedule should stabilize within a month, so in the meantime we agree to the following so that he can continue to make some progress (1% a day) to maintain some momentum:

1) <@1054411267340763216> will follow-up with Jose to check-in with him once a week to make sure he is maintaining some degree of progress - no need to keep following up regarding homework and assignments until Jose schedule stabilizes
2) <@1218639416277467216> committed to consume the content in the vault, take notes and implement what he can, his focus will be to take some action in making progress with Product Research & Analysis
3) <@1218639416277467216> will not be able to attend classes due to his schedule being unpredictable, but he will leverage this dedicated private channel for questions as he reviews the content

<@1054411267340763216> Please give Jose some breathing room, he is committed to taking small actions every week to move forward, when he becomes more stable with his job's schedule, we'll ramp up and help him catch up

<@1218639416277467216> We're here to support you but we'll need you to keep us updated on your progress when Minh checks in on you, stay strong brother and do your best to stay engaged
  - 2024-10-30 | @everyone Team - Please welcome Aimy back, she is re-engaged after our conversation and is determined to build her Amazon business 💪 She is currently pursuing her real estate license in FL but is committed to the program. We will re-evaluate her membership in 6 months but let's make sure she hit her goals and find a product!

<@1054411267340763216> Aimy will book a welcome call with you to re-orient herself as the program changed significantly since she last got involved, let's follow the process and get her familiar with the new program structure, class schedule, homework, and etc.

<@296142820849221633> We’ll revisit your active support in 6 months and discuss your options then, but let’s get you stabilized and profitable in the meantime, please book your launching call with Han ASAP, here is the booking link:

  - 2024-08-09 | does PPC work like an auction? Where if you bid more conservatively like suggested $3 you do $2 the other guy bids $3, $3.5, $4 will be above you on the key word search? Also running a ppc campaign does it shows up as sponsor right? the ones that show up without sponsor ranked organically?
  - 2024-08-08 | Got it makes sense thanks for explaining!
  - 2024-08-08 | What does CPR stand for? I googled it it says cerebro product rank so then the lower the better right? But then <@536075832658231299> PPC video says it stands for "the number of sales in the last 8 days" so then that means the higher the number the better??
  - 2024-11-04 | Yes, let me join in. I’m gonna start attending Wednesday’s class this week.

  - 2024-10-17 | with Zelle, I’m afraid I can’t get the money back if they don’t follow through
  - 2024-10-17 | I probably should do the friends and family thing right where it charges a little extra, but you can get the money back?
  - 2024-10-17 | That’s what I’m afraid of too. It’s my first time working with an influencer. How do you usually pay them through Zelle?

  - 2024-10-17 | Hi, I was wondering I got an influencer and she is asking for 300 hundred dollars for a I plan to ship her out the product. Do you usually pay them after or before they make the video she is asking me to pay her before she makes a video.

Mindset Preparation: here is a list of books you will need to start reading right away to prepare mentally for this journey

1 . The Atomic Habit: to help you break your own broke habits and build your rich habits

2. The Secret: Learn the power of the mind and that your thoughts can become things

3. The 4 Hours Work Week: Get a preview of what it actually is to be running your business online

Watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA-Ero900TY for the list of books you must read before class starting and during this journey. I recommend to read 2 books per month.

  - 2024-03-03 | 🙏🏼 Happy Sabbath and a blessed Sunday to you all. We would like to take this moment to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who generously donated to our cause. With the hustle of preparation and budgeting, organizing has proven to be quite challenging, especially with the time zone differences and varying availabilities in the Philippines. However, despite these obstacles, we are committed to fulfilling our mission with grateful hearts.

On behalf of myself, <@1100405164432707645> , and my brother Ruben, we extend our sincerest thanks to each and every one of you for your unwavering support. Special thanks to <@985885913320132629>   <@975774205658411068>  <@536075832658231299> <@705204493620478032>  <@1054411267340763216>  for allowing us to share our journey here. Although it may seem like a small victory, we are thrilled to announce that we have achieved 78% of our target goal.

Thank you once again for your generosity and support!🩵 🙏🏼

  - 2024-11-14 | Weekly reflection: Got really sick over the weekend and finally feeling somewhat normal today. Rested a lot las few days and took a break from working since my head was in a fog. Was able to reschedule meeting with Minh, have been mostly consistent in waking up early to start sauna, & walk dog. Journaling hasn't been every day but have been getting it in more than before. Also finally found a product and spent last week finishing module 2, creating AMZ seller account, got my EIN & business CC.

Weekly Goal:
Wake up an hour earlier each day to start day with gratitude/meditation, sauna, journal & walking dog.
Work on sourcing at least 1 hour a day.
Research more on how to increase business funding
  - 2024-11-04 | Weekly reflection: Consistently spent extra time on PR every day. Have been  getting into  a really good pace in different strategies and utilizing all my resources. Also spent time journaling highs and lows to help my see things in my days that I am grateful for and to recognize areas where I am spending in negative thought patterns and flip the narrative and to be there and support myself. Did schedule time with Minh to discuss further plans but hiccup was a Zoom link error & was able to link with Accountability Partner: <@1258482095337111645>

Weekly Goal:
1. Wake up an hour earlier each day to start day with gratitude/meditation, sauna, journal & walking dog.
2. Reschedule meeting with Minh.
3. Continue spending 2 hour minimum on PR to get my final product.
  - 2024-10-29 | Weekly Goal: 1) Keep up with at least 2 hours of PR daily
2) Talk to Minh after Tuesday class on PR progress and troubleshooting
3) Daily journal for mental health & business vision

  - 2024-11-07 | Any tips of boosting business credit card line? I was approved for only $3000, which likely wouldn't cover first batch cost. I put for expected average monthly costs to be $3000 and current annual revenue as $0. Should I reach out to an agent and see if they can adjust?
  - 2024-11-09 | 3 mi + shoulder & arms
  - 2024-11-04 | 2 mi run + whole body workout
  - 2024-11-02 | Leg day

  - 2024-11-06 | Sent you a DM <@1054411267340763216>!
  - 2024-10-24 | For anyone still in the PR stage: I know we were all recommended to use the old version of XRay but after talking to customer support, Helium 10 has taken out that option moving forward.
  - 2024-10-02 | Just caught up to messages and saw the PR class was changed to Tuesday. Will send in my homework when I get home tonight
  - 2024-11-01 | Had to leave to an appointment but going to try to finish in time to hop on for the end of the call

  - 2024-11-05 | Just gotta be patient. Sometimes it could be customers finances not working out lol
  - 2024-11-05 | Like I still have one pending from Nov 1st
  - 2024-11-05 | Sometimes some of my orders take days as well
  - 2024-11-05 | But that's normal
  - 2024-11-05 | Not too sure why sometimes orders can take long time to process. It's on Amazons end for sure. But all I can do is 🤞🏼🤞🏼 hope that it gets shipped
  - 2024-11-04 | Thank you!!

  - 2024-10-29 | So how do you determine what size tier the products are in?
  - 2024-10-14 | No problem! Don't be afraid to reach out! Im sure alot of us here are willing to help out if you need anything, myself included.
  - 2024-10-13 | Product research phase is not easy for sure guys. It took me 2-3 months of constant searching putting in 1-3 hours everyday. It will all be worth it when you find your potential product. Reverse lookup on Alibaba. Look on TikTok #tiktokmademebuyit, Brookstone, IG, Just to name a few. Look on other big company website and see what they are selling. Keep browsing around. Trust the process and don't lose faith! You got this! 💪🏼

  - 2024-11-06 | and cherry on top, yesterday I had the most impressions since my launch
  - 2024-11-06 | I was in the same boat with advertising eating my profits with little to no sales but ended up optimized my PPC. After optimization, I had the same results with impression, clicks, etc (surprisingly) and now it doesn't hurt as bad.

  - 2024-11-14 | Hey sorry I wasn't able to make it to this class. I was on an airplane during the meeting 😢
  - 2024-11-08 | Ill try to commit doing 40 questions a day and that would help me complete it to submit the next time
  - 2024-11-08 | Hey Jamie. Everything is going okay. Lately I just hired a VA to help me with my social media so after work (which is usually really late) I'm communicating with my VA to that up and running
  - 2024-10-12 | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N-4HGKAI7HYAsn391COB6BdQd9oyEzUN75n_REJN1BQ/edit
  - 2024-10-12 | <@536075832658231299>  is it okay if I schedule my 1 on 1 call next week with you to help me optimize my campaign after looking at my ppc tracker?
  - 2024-10-10 | Thank you 🙂
  - 2024-10-10 | Based off the homework, I'm assuming the CPC price
  - 2024-10-10 | When increasing/decreasing my bids, do I adjust it based off the my original bid price or the CPC price?
  - 2024-11-04 | It's the same offer. That's what I thought too. But I doubled checked with the Amazon representative bc I didn't see that it says 14 consecutive days. And that's why he said what he said in the email.
  - 2024-11-04 | 
  - 2024-11-04 | So I reached out to Amazon about the sponsored brands campaign and they said it has to start on or before 11/7/24 (the date the promotion ends) and it has to be running for at least 14 consecutive days. Just sharing some knowledge so you don't get caught off guard
  - 2024-11-03 | 
  - 2024-11-03 | Did you know that Amazon has an experiment feature in which you can experiment with different versions of content for your product. Just wanted to share what I learned today.
  - 2024-11-02 | I will in the future when I'm eligible to make "deals" but currently I don't meet the requirements for the deal
  - 2024-11-02 | Right? When I saw that from my competitor.... I was like... 😑 FAKE SALEEEEE!! But smart😭
  - 2024-11-02 | https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1293219742408114208/1302366369328922624/Screenshot_2024-11-02_151840.png?ex=6727dab3&is=67268933&hm=4ef57a97ab5694c2c03257c750b8b43cc12eed5f83604a74f4d184585a67016c&
  - 2024-11-02 | And for those asking about the criteria for the lightning deal..or deals in general
  - 2024-11-02 | Using the lightning deal promotion as leverage
  - 2024-11-02 | It's basically a "fake" sale like how you mentioned
  - 2024-11-02 | So my top competitor sells his product with the coupon. And when he has a lightning deal, the coupon gets removed and the lightning deal is the same price as how much it would have been with the coupon
  - 2024-11-01 | Now you see why it's important to have organic sales and bring in customers organically
  - 2024-11-01 | Yeap! That's why Amazon is so rich!
  - 2024-11-01 | Some days I receive no pay so I have no payouts. I just donate 😭
  - 2024-11-01 | Think of it like this, what if you had no payouts? Do you think Amazon is gonna give you ads for freeeeee?

  - 2024-11-01 | everyone's product is different so it's hard to say what the "check list" is. general things you'll want to look for are:

Functionality (verify that the product functions as intended)
Check for consistency in color and finish
Ensure branding (logos, labels, prints) is applied correctly
Check that labels and barcodes are correctly printed
Ensure all pieces are correctly assembled and firmly in place
Test any attached or included accessories
Check that all included instructions or manuals are clear, accurate, and printed without typos.

  - 2024-10-08 | i personally look at each campaign individually. if they are performing (i.e. making sales and meeting target acos or lower, i will increase. if it's just a bit above target acos, i would still increase). if they haven't performed at all, i will not increase.

  - 2024-10-26 | if you have a custom package, work it into the design. if you don't, just do the sticker label for now. first batch, i did sticker labels then included it on the packaging for every re-order

  - 2024-10-22 | there's no right or wrong warehouse to pick. you're just trying to get an estimate at this point.

  - 2024-08-09 | This is correct!
  - 2024-08-08 | See ^ - higher means harder and more competitive to rank on. It's good if you are meeting those numbers, but as a new seller we need to balance using a good mix of higher and lower cpr words with a decent search volume.
  - 2024-08-08 | 
  - 2024-10-29 | Seems like I need to do this homework too 😂
  - 2024-11-10 | Who left the review?
  - 2024-11-03 | 20% off your current selling price
  - 2024-11-03 | i believe it has to be 20% minimum discount from the lowest price you've been selling at. han correct me if i'm wrong.
  - 2024-11-03 | i usually just do the % off and then set minimum price but there's no wrong way
  - 2024-11-17 | olesia i will do this for you today.

but if you go to inventory, manage all inventory, click edit on the FBA listing, all the copy will be on the product details tab
  - 2024-11-15 | be sure to select han
  - 2024-11-15 | you can book your call with han - https://amzshifu.com/coach-1on1
  - 2024-10-18 | <@536075832658231299> <@1054411267340763216> do you guys know what we're recommending for mentees to do when the supplier doesn't provide tracking for sea shipments?
  - 2024-10-14 | from olesia - <@536075832658231299> not sure if you have feedback/want to chime in.

for me personally, i would not worry about making it known to the organization yet. if you already know that's who you will donate money to, you can just do it and as you grow bigger the organization will eventually notice. you can still promote the organization in your content because that is who you plan to donate the goods to.
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1230862203146473472> , i will add your question in here about charity so han can see too. is that ok?
  - 2024-10-20 | there's really no way of knowing so don't stress too hard on this
  - 2024-10-20 | you can pick any to get a quote. just keep in mind that if you pick one in CA, shipping may end up being higher if that's the the one your goods get sent to
  - 2024-10-18 | this happened to me on my first bulk order
  - 2024-10-18 | sucks to be quoted 400 for WC then when you actually do shipping, you have to ship to a bunch of EC warehouses and the rate is 1000
  - 2024-10-18 | oh that will probably be expensive but you won't have any surprises when you actually ship haha
  - 2024-10-18 | my guess is most will try using a west coast warehouse to show the cheapest rate
  - 2024-10-18 | yeah so it could be worth asking or maybe you can say, can you quote me to ship to X warehouse at amazon
  - 2024-10-18 | this is the "Warehouse ID"
  - 2024-10-18 | yes but to get quote they would have to know "we are shipping from china to amz warehouse MDW2" or something like that
  - 2024-10-18 | i'm wondering what destination they used to get their shipping quote... because WC rates will be much less than EC or midwest. but yes def ask about one near you.

if needed you can check with a few shipping agents to compare too.
  - 2024-10-18 | do you know which warehouse was used as point of reference?
  - 2024-10-18 | as far as the shipping cost/unit itself?
  - 2024-10-18 | do you know what the break down is?
  - 2024-10-18 | you mean your supplier already gave you a shipping estimate, which was included in your total bulk order?
  - 2024-10-10 | I usually go off cpc if I need to aggressively bring acos down, otherwise I go off the current bid

Your bid is the max you’re willing to pay
  - 2024-10-14 | i would just close if 2 units. when is your next batch coming?
  - 2024-10-14 | thats fine
  - 2024-10-14 | just make sure you reopen before 30 days so the units don't get returned to you
  - 2024-10-14 | how long has it been? the 30 day rule han mentioned before still applies and amazon may automatically reopen your listing
  - 2024-10-14 | it could be returns, could be. units they lost and found. this happens often
  - 2024-11-03 | han and minh both may have different approach too! but that's what i do
  - 2024-11-03 | there's no right or wrong way to do this as i believe it's preference. so you can do a bulk adjustment (decrease by %, then increase after it's over). i cherry picked the ones that were bleeding out during that timeframe
  - 2024-11-03 | i also drop my budget
  - 2024-11-03 | when i notice that their deal is cannibalizing my sales
  - 2024-11-03 | i do
  - 2024-10-28 | phuong i sent you a video on where/how to export like 2 weeks ago
  - 2024-10-28 | have you checked the market? last week, i noticed my sales were sooooo slow. when that happens i often look at my market to see what's happening. i found out my top competitor was running a limited time deal 7 days, priced 15 cheaper than my product. the sale ended last night and my sales seem to have returned to normal.
  - 2024-10-17 | but if they find the units later, they'll take the money back
  - 2024-10-17 | if it's their fault i believe they'll reimburse you
  - 2024-10-17 | yeah your invoice should be fine in this case. i think this is a new process. i have had so many discrepancies and they never asked me to upload anything. only  one time when they said they didn't have an entire shipment.
  - 2024-10-15 | In general if the quality is worthy of purchasing. Do you think it’s worth using as an ad later in the future? That kind of thing
  - 2024-10-15 | i found a way to do this but it's tricky and requires some trial and error. he might ask you to take it down if he catches it too... just a note

500 is not really bad, if he won't negotiate down, ask if you can decide after the video has been posted. that way you know if it's worth your time or not
  - 2024-10-15 | i wonder if you can just download the story once it's live lol let me test
  - 2024-10-15 | i think it's a good test, but try to see if you can get a copy of that video
  - 2024-10-15 | and is it a story series for just 1 story slide?
  - 2024-10-15 | see if he will share the story video with you after (like for you to keep for yourself)
  - 2024-10-15 | what %?
  - 2024-10-15 | did he send you proof of big US audience?
  - 2024-10-21 | this can happen anytime. the market moves fast. speed of execution is key.
  - 2024-10-17 | I skipped package design on my first batch. It’s a nice touch but not worth risking if you’re required To have 1000 units. I did custom package on second batch.
  - 2024-10-16 | too risky. agree with minh 👆 need proof of concept first
  - 2024-11-02 | i always recommend having a list or idea of what you need. for example: 

- 2 product shots on white background
- 5 lifestyle photos with product (briefly describe setting/mood/vibe and whether it should or should not have people)

if you're not good at describing, create a pinterest moodboard to share w/ photographer.

you cannot rely on someone especially graphic designer or photographer to communicate your brand.

if you're not sure how much you need, it might be better to plan the website first and ask for photo assets later. Or - if you don't know but want the photos first, you can just ask for flat 10-15 pics that you can repurpose and use for anything else.
  - 2024-10-31 | can you send me a google doc - what images/how many
  - 2024-10-31 | what do you need done?
  - 2024-10-30 | for shopify
  - 2024-10-30 | if your product is selling well with the current listing, maybe don't need to stress too much about it, but you can hire photographer or graphic designer to get more photos of your product
  - 2024-10-30 | social media has no effect on shopify it's just a nice touch
  - 2024-10-30 | also you need to have copy written for the site - a few blog posts, about us, shipping/returns. this will help with seo
  - 2024-10-30 | <@536075832658231299> do you have referral or feedback for chloe
  - 2024-10-30 | chloe asked:

I'm thinking about hiring someone to help me set up Shopify. Can you recommend anyone? Or are there specific things I should ask them to do or pay attention ? I’d like to write them down to make it easier to find someone online.

-----

I don't have a referral but here are somethings i would ask for:

1. Have a blog section
2. have a banner at the top that incentivizes a purchase (like save 10% or free shipping or something)
3. have a pop up email opt-in  and email opt-in form that lives on the homepage. offer somethign in exchange for the email (like free ebook, or 10% off first purchase - something like that)
4. connect shopify to email (like klaviyo or mailchimp)
5. must have high-quality/strong images of hero product to use on website
6. definitely need product listing
7. connect social or have links to social media
  - 2024-10-21 | did you get this resolved? i can't tell from the thread in the active channel
  - 2024-10-29 | I tagged you in a thread in active support
  - 2024-10-29 | are you sea shipping? sometimes they cannot provide a tracking #
  - 2024-10-16 | inspection is similar price for everyone. shipping is where rates can vary - and reasonable is subjective as everyone's product size, type, etc varies. things to consider if it's reasonable for you:

1. does it significantly impact your overall margin? 
2. have you gotten 2-3 other quotes to compare so you stretch every penny you can?
3. how long will it take? 
4. do you need to get it here faster? if so, do you need to consider partial air and sea shipping.

  - 2024-10-11 | for seo at minimum
  - 2024-10-11 | i know... i'm just thinking we at least want him to post it lol
  - 2024-10-11 | maybe something less snarky so he actually posts it? something along these lines... just a thought - maybe you can merge the two somehow or feel free to post your response 😅 

Thank you for sending over the video this morning. We truly appreciate your patience and understanding throughout the process, especially given the initial delay caused by the software update. While we had communicated our decision to part ways due to the extended timeline, we’d be happy to move forward with the first posting of the video and will no longer request the payment. We’re grateful for your effort and contribution, and we’d love to conclude our sponsorship on a positive note. Thank you again
  - 2024-10-11 | i'm thinking the same. he has 31k subscribers on youtube. i suggested taking the shitty video and not moving forward with second video
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont want him to make a video NOT recommending it or talking about how much it sucks
  - 2024-11-04 | give me 5 mins. is that good for you?
  - 2024-11-04 | Well 9 est for me
  - 2024-11-04 | Yes
  - 2024-10-29 | you can drop price to see if it drives more sales. 

have you played with optimizing your listing images?
  - 2024-10-15 | you have to make a copy of the sheet tam (file > make a copy)
  - 2024-10-15 | this one?
  - 2024-10-15 | make a copy of it then you can edit
  - 2024-10-15 | get it from the PPC Tracking Tutorial

  - 2024-10-14 | i still get stressed out and lose sleep over inventory and shipping. it never ends lol
  - 2024-10-13 | 
  - 2024-10-12 | <@809813064756887582> did you have the date range from the day you first launched on these campaigns? i think you need to double the bid on your auto campaign targets. only .20 for each target and no impressions.
  - 2024-10-30 | <@536075832658231299> did you ever resolve gem's issue with the deeplink?

  - 2024-10-13 | hi thuy posting your question in your private channel for the team to see too.

"So after barebone listing, should i create a contract with supplier and schedule a call with the instructors so i can place the bulk order?"

<@1054411267340763216> is thuy required to schedule a call before the bulk order?
  - 2024-11-14 | <@536075832658231299> did you know carolina is selling at 15% margin right now? she's 50% through her inventory, i was wondering if we should bring up her price?
  - 2024-10-14 | should be good
  - 2024-10-14 | make sure you sell some FBM at the 30% higher price
  - 2024-10-14 | ignore sale price bc you're not running a sale.

make list price 30% higher than your price
  - 2024-10-14 | <@613172337470341150> share the screen on your pricing. what's it look like righ tnow
  - 2024-10-21 | <@536075832658231299> <@1054411267340763216> i can't seem to troubleshoot the deep link for gem. do you guys have feedback?

this is the product - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D937HW3R

  - 2024-10-30 | no you shouldn't have to
  - 2024-10-15 | Amazon can hold payment for over 14 days, as an “account level reserve.” This is something you agreed to, when you signed up.

The reserve amount is determined by various things. These include how long you’ve had your account, returns, reviews, and if you have any unresolved disputes.

if everything is good, you will eventually be paid out for everything just takes some time at first
  - 2024-10-15 | <@1213335800205414452> sorry for the delay. reposting your ? here in case han can provide better explanation too

" I was not sure about Account Level Reserved. Why amz keep much on these?"

  - 2024-10-17 | their preferred method. for all of mine, it has been paypal

  - 2024-10-17 | someone recently paid a deposit and the influencer did not deliver
  - 2024-10-17 | it's standard from my experience over the past decade to pay after the assets are delivered
  - 2024-10-17 | hi this is your private channel

  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you guys. So yes I checked and I have to submit one document from the manufacturer and another document to the FDA to get an accession number
  - 2024-11-14 | has anyone had this before?
  - 2024-11-14 | but if I take the word laser out of the product description page and it gets unblocked, it wouldn't make much sense to even sell this product because the main attribute is the laser.
  - 2024-11-14 | They just requested I change the details on the product description page
  - 2024-11-14 | dummy listing
  - 2024-11-14 | My listing for a laser product is currently being blocked because the Amazon system is classifying it as a class III and class IV but in reality this is Class II, which is acceptable. I submitted my appeal on the Amazon portal but they are still blocking it after review. Any thoughts on how I can get this resolved?
  - 2024-11-13 | In order to start gathering reviews for my listing, do I have to go through trademark and brand registry first?
  - 2024-11-11 | Hope this is enough for the listing to stay up. I can wait another day or two just to be safe.
  - 2024-11-11 | 
  - 2024-11-11 | provided from the manufacturer.
  - 2024-11-11 | I submitted a safety data sheet
  - 2024-11-11 | I have an 1 day old active dummy listing (thanks <@1054411267340763216>) , it has been a day since I submitted my SDS/exemption sheets documents. Should I wait a couple more days to be safe that it stays active?
  - 2024-11-09 | They are about $30 each
  - 2024-11-09 | I’ve been stuck with this issue for a week, it would help to get the tutorial
  - 2024-11-09 | The upc bought from nationwide or from gs1?
  - 2024-11-09 | Oh is there? Omg that would help so much
  - 2024-11-09 | From the Gs1 website, I am required to put a brand name when purchasing a barcode which is why I have encountered the error as well. There is no feature in Gs1 that allows me to buy a upc code with a generic brand name
  - 2024-11-09 | I bought one from nationwide barcode and another one from
Gs1 I tried both and while putting the generic brand name I’m having error 8572 from the attached as I listed above
  - 2024-11-09 | Hi Hannah. I will definitely try again. Did you put your your brand as generic or n/a when it went through
  - 2024-11-09 | 
  - 2024-11-09 | I put the brand name as "n/a" since that was suggested from nationwide barcodes. and it gievs me the error above, and when I select generic for the brand name, it will give me Error 8572. The error below
  - 2024-11-09 | 
  - 2024-11-09 | Hey <@1054411267340763216> Here is a screenshot of the error I am having
  - 2024-11-05 | I am figuring out the dummy listing at the moment, since the UPC code I got from GS1 is registered to a brand name, it is not allowing me to list the product as Generic Brand on Amazon. Does it make sense to buy a UPC code from elsewhere that does not have a brand name assigned to it

  - 2024-11-08 | Hi Jamie! I do apologize on being late for the HW submissions. I am starting a new job Monday and have been a little caught up in getting ready for that. I still have PPC HW #3 and inventory management HW #1 to finish and submit. I will find time this weekend to work on them.
  - 2024-10-27 | Then after about 2 weeks of fully launched.... I can submit over the PPC assistance right? I think those are the steps but please let know if I'm missing anything, thanks!!
  - 2024-10-27 | Hi Jamie! I've finished inventory #1 HW and will submit over as I'm still working on #2 and #3. For the data visibility.... my campaigns are set to start on Wednesday 10/30 so once I gather the data I will submit over but you said I can just submit once and update weekly right?

  - 2024-11-09 | Hi <@691122008930648136> . No need to click on the refund button. Amazon will automatically refund customers when they initiate a return.  The returned item will follow your return process you have setup in your business settings.

  - 2024-03-05 | Hi everyone. When filing for a trademark, would you suggest paying for their service to search USPTO records? I did a high level search and it looks like there are no conflicts. However, just wanted to ensure it doesn't get denied and cause further delay.
  - 2024-11-12 | That's correct. When you're planning your shipment, you would coordinate the locations with your freight forwarder. They'll let you know the price for the locations you selected. Once you both agree to the locations to be shipped to, you can finalize the shipment plan on Amazon.
  - 2024-11-12 | Hi Sovatha. That's correct. The maximum weight for an Amazon FBA box is 50 lbs, unless the box contains a single oversized item that weighs more than 50 lbs,which I don't think applies to most of us here.  

You can ship to 1, 3, or 5 locations. The assumption is that if you ship to multiple Amazon warehouses, the quicker your inventory will be available. However, I would check the amazon location with your freight forwarder to see which option is the most cost effective and makes the most sense for you. Most students here ship to 3 or 1 location.
  - 2024-11-12 | Jennifer,that's odd. I checked my other reviews and it's up. I can try to submit again.
  - 2024-11-14 | Yes. That's it
  - 2024-11-14 | You should see it there
  - 2024-11-14 | It's in your shipping queue
  - 2024-11-13 | then update your shipment window to ensure it arrives within that window
  - 2024-11-13 | ahh got it... you should be good. I would check with your freight forwarder once in a while to get an idea of where your inventory is at and when its scheduled to arrive at Port and ETA on when it will arrive to amazon warehouse...
  - 2024-11-13 | the shipment ID/reference ID is something they usually collect from us... did they notice your tracking number and just mentioned that it was wrong?
  - 2024-11-13 | as long as your inventory arrives within the window you set, you are totally fine
  - 2024-11-13 | however, in your case,  they didnt provide you one..so the method i provided you is the work around
  - 2024-11-13 | Amazon requires us to input a tracking number...
  - 2024-11-13 | If they are not providing you with a trackable Tracking number, it doesn't affect them at all
  - 2024-11-13 | the tracking number wasn't something they provided you correct?
  - 2024-11-13 | yea.. usually i supply the reference ID
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Kazoua! Your freight forwarder told you your shipping # is wrong?  Can you gather more info on what they are asking for? Could they possibly be asking for info from you (shipment id, reference id)?

If it's regarding Tracking #, you can always update that.
  - 2024-10-30 | however, if your freight forwarder doesn't have a valid tracking for you, please select "Others" ..amazon system will not check against anything..and your random character/numbers will be accepted
  - 2024-10-30 | If you selected a specific carrier, it will check against what you have selected..
  - 2024-10-30 | 
  - 2024-10-30 | Hi <@1256245998255345695> - Can you change your "Carrier" to "Others" and try again?
  - 2024-11-15 | Got it. I have added a "priority" column and will set it accordingly
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi All. Hope everyone is doing well! I apologize for the delay. My kids been sick since halloween and I didn't have much free time. However, they are all better now so I'm getting back into things. Thanks for your understanding.

I'm sharing everyone:

1. Spreadsheet with notes/suggestions. I'm reviewing each video in the vault starting with the Product Research stage and adding in suggestions/KB ideas.  Loom Video for more detail.

  - 2024-11-07 | I'll support her as needed.
  - 2024-11-07 | Sure. We've been in contact and chat quite often since she launched.
  - 2024-11-07 | Hi <@454372168852045844>.  I've been in comms with her and will reach out to her to see if she wants to talk! I'll keep you all posted!
  - 2024-11-06 | Yea kids are back to school today, so I'll have some time to focus. Thanks for understanding
  - 2024-11-06 | I'll share with you and sync up with Jamie to get things moving along
  - 2024-11-06 | Hi <@454372168852045844> . Tbh I barely gotten started. My kids been sick the day after Halloween.  I should get the things going after today. Sorry for the delay.
  - 2024-10-31 | Sure! Thanks
  - 2024-10-30 | <@454372168852045844> - We still meeting? Currently waiting to join.

  - 2024-10-30 | Ok I take that back, revert back
  - 2024-10-30 | My OCD level just went through the roof...unread .....
  - 2024-10-30 | Omg...maybe I shouldn't have asked about the private channels
  - 2024-10-30 | Lol build a script to automate it..jk
  - 2024-10-30 | I don't have visibility to the private channels with each members, not sure how active he is in those channels
  - 2024-10-30 | No problem. Yea, I help him here and there, but he seems very quiet so I encouraged him to reach out more if he needs help/guidance. If anyone connects with me and raises any concerns, I'll give y'all a heads up.
  - 2024-10-30 | Just wanted to give you all a heads up in case he needs help, we can prioritize
  - 2024-10-30 | I think he'll be ok
  - 2024-10-30 | I think he is the type that is a little quiet and doesn't ask for help when needed. So I encourage him to reach out and be more active.
  - 2024-10-30 | Hi All. Had a conversation with Lowell this morning as he asked me about a customer complaint and he shared a little bit about his challenges. I wanted to share with you all so we're all aware of his emotional state, in case he needs additional support from the team.

Name: Lowell Gimena
Status: Launched

Current Challenges:

- High ACOS / Low Profit
- Customer Filed Complaint (I assisted him with this)
- Supplier delays
- Feels unsupported

Current Resolution / Actions: I encouraged him to focus on what he can do when challenges come up as this journey is truly an emotional rollercoaster. 

We identified that he needs to reach out and ask for help as it's one of the personal challenges he hasn't taken. I also directed him to the post launch meeting that you all are offering!  He mentioned he already reached out to Justin and I believe he got assistance. 

He also said that before he launched, he used up his 1 call. So he felt as though he can't get anymore assistance.
  - 2024-10-30 | We started together as she was in my class.. so im super happy for her successful launch
  - 2024-10-30 | No worries! Happy she's doing well and glad you all helped her as well!
  - 2024-10-29 | Got it. Thanks
  - 2024-10-29 | <@454372168852045844> - sometime after 10:30AM PST should work.
  - 2024-10-28 | I can meet sometime this week.  Wednesday is a little open if your schedule permits.
  - 2024-10-28 | <@454372168852045844> - Here is a quick video I made to go over the Daily SOP. Hope that helps
  - 2024-10-28 | https://www.loom.com/share/565823140d70473aa6d9ccb077879f5c?sid=d1fa52c5-973d-4cbe-850f-0e4d0925ebca
  - 2024-10-28 | Hi Tom. Yes. I have Loom and used it in the previous recording. I can create a video and share.
  - 2024-10-23 | Done
  - 2024-10-23 | Does the info above live somewhere on a sheet or page on in the vault? I'd like to link this checklist/daily action items. If it doesn't exisit, can we add these Daily Action Items for Product research in the Vault? Possible the first module  (Intro to Product Research)? <@454372168852045844>
  - 2024-10-23 | Recommended Daily Action Items.
30 minutes of researching products
Fill in product tracking sheet with at least 3-5 products (don’t have to be good products)
  PRODUCT_TRACKING_SHEET.xlsx
If a potential product is found, complete the analysis form
  1._PRODUCT_ANALYSIS_SHEET_EXAMPLE_final_1.docx
Join Group study and peer study with accountability partners.
Engage in Discord group (questions, issues, etc.)
When you have a potential product would like to analyze , please prepare by watching this tutorial video : https://www.loom.com/share/86597d1a0977421ba07890f426ef881b

💡 IMPORTANT! 
Submit your weekly homework. This is a requirement to help keep you on track 👇
**https://airtable.com/appMORc7BoAe5FJHc/shrifKkmVQlsO8grS
  - 2024-10-23 | Got it. I redirected the activity directly to the "[WEEK 2] Module 1 - Part 1: Product Research"
  - 2024-10-23 | I'll redirect the link to the Vault
  - 2024-10-23 | OK. Do you know where specific that info lives?
  - 2024-10-23 | <@454372168852045844> - Sure I can add this. I believe I have already linked one of the activities to "Product Research" stage to the syllabus. However, I'm checking the syllabus and noticed "Stage 1" is now gone. I'm assuming it's currently not there because Minh is working on it?
  - 2024-10-23 | Tom - I think the Daily Top - 2 in the  "Community" section makes sense.  It'll give visibility to all community members and help encourage people to stay focus as they see their peers posting/ working on their business daily. 

Suggestion for the Channel Name: "My Daily Top 2s"
  - 2024-10-22 | Yes. 1PM PST (3PM CT) works.
  - 2024-10-22 | yes. I can be available today
  - 2024-10-22 | Perfect. I updated the SOP with the updated image.
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi <@454372168852045844> - No problem. We can do something between 2PM - 3PM PST (4PM- 5PM CY) if that works for you.

  - 2024-11-09 | Saturday reflection:
1. I hit almost of my goals this week, just can’t keep up on posting on IG consistently. 
2. I’ve finally completed redesigning my Manychat to create a better version.

3. Planning for next week:
-Continue preparing PPC lists, get everything ready to launch. Hopefully my product can be ready for Christmas sales
4. Have a great weekend fam ✌️
  - 2024-11-08 | Let's go brother 🔥  The fam still here!!!
  - 2024-11-06 | 3 goals for this week:
1. Re-design Manychat to be more efficient 
2. Keep posting on IG theme page at least 1 post/day
3. Since goods is on the way, I will continue with PPC keyword lists, starting next week
4. Have a great day fam! ✌️

11/02/2024

The production is finally finished ✅
Inspection PASSED ✅ (There were a few minor defects, but the supplier noted them down and assured they won’t happen in the next batch.)
70% remaining balance PAID ✅ (This step was a bit tricky for me because my credit card limit wasn’t enough to cover it. Alibaba doesn’t accept multiple payments, and the supplier couldn’t figure out a way to split the invoice. But I remembered a call with Shifu Justin to contact the bank and request a credit limit increase. Thankfully, they approved it, so my credit limit was enough to cover the balance.)

Hopefully, the goods will be on their way soon and available to sell before Christmas 🎅

The production is finally finished ✅
Inspection PASSED ✅ (There were a few minor defects, but the supplier noted them down and assured they won’t happen in the next batch.)
70% remaining balance PAID ✅ (This step was a bit tricky for me because my credit card limit wasn’t enough to cover it. Alibaba doesn’t accept multiple payments, and the supplier couldn’t figure out a way to split the invoice. But I remembered a call with Shifu Justin to contact the bank and request a credit limit increase. Thankfully, they approved it, so my credit limit was enough to cover the balance.)

Hopefully, the goods will be on their way soon and available to sell before Christmas 🎅

My goods will be sent out next week but they didn’t tell me it’ll be push back or anything, even with 2 or 5 shipments.

  - 2024-11-14 | Hi everyone, I want to share a bit about return rate 😁  If you're feeling down about seeing a lot of customers return products on 1st and 2nd batch, don't worry too much. It's normal to have a high return rate with the 1st n 2nd batch. Amazon can still sell returned products, or if they’re unfulfilled, they’ll send them back to us or our 3PL, we can repackage and sell them as FBM or resend them to Amazon for resale. The only thing we can do is focus on improving the product and updating the listing images . My return rate was more than 15%, and I know others with rates as high as 25%. The return rate will drops as you get more reviews and after product improvement. I've even received unopened, brand-new returns marked as "not working." 🤣 Sometimes, people just enjoy buying things and then returning them. I hope this makes you feel better🫶 😁

  - 2024-11-16 | Thank you <@975774205658411068>  for sharing information🙂  I would recommend Larry for this service, since I think doing FBM orders for reviews can be risky. Some of you may not want to leak the product, or you might not have family members live in US to help out. Many of the mentee accounts here have a long buying history, but they rarely leave product reviews, and start leaving reviews for new accounts, which Amazon could track it (as inappropriate). Asking them for help could increase the chances of your listing getting blocked, or even their account being flagged, which could also affect our selling account. However, keep in mind that this service is a bit pricey since you have to pay everything upfront.

Hiring someone on Fiverr to help write the product description, bullet points, and anything else related to the product. Test it to see if Amazon flags it. Keep trying until Amazon approves the listing.

Make sure to explain your situation to the freelancer and ask if they can help update the listing description until it gets approved, but clarify this before paying them for the work. AGAIN YOU CAN TRY BUT NO WARRANTEE🙂

  - 2024-11-11 | And about the negotiation <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-11 | 🙏🏼😬
  - 2024-11-11 | And about storing goods in a 3PL warehouse and then shipping them to a nearby Amazon warehouse. I don’t understand if we order too much for small business like me. I can't generate enough cash flow because we have too much inventory in the warehouse. Also, is there really a significant difference between storing goods in an Amazon warehouse and a 3PL? Usually, we’re still able to sell those batches within three months to avoid extra fees on top? And those fees are tax write off. And during the holidays, even when we send inventory to Amazon, it still takes a while for them to receive it. So, what’s the benefit of storing in a warehouse and shipping to Amazon later?
  - 2024-11-11 | Is it normal to keep negotiating the price? I always negotiate the price down every time I place an order. I still want to maintain a good relationship and make sure I’m doing it right, at least ensuring they feel comfortable. When should we stop negotiating the price with the manufacturer?
  - 2024-11-11 | Hi everyone, can you please give me some advice? I’m thinking of switching to FBM to reduce fees, but I’m concerned that it means we’ll have to handle all customer service and returns, which would require hiring someone to be available 24/7 to manage these issues. I still prefer FBA since it’s managed by Amazon and includes Prime shipping, but is there a way to reduce the fees? Or should we consider a mix of FBM and FBA? Also, when we start selling on other platforms in the future, we’ll still use a 3PL for storage and shipping, right?
  - 2024-11-08 | Sorry Jamie and everyone I just get busy around holiday time and totally lost track of time. It’s just too much on my hands right now. I can’t even join any classes during the week. But I will try my best to catch up and turn in hw on time 🥲
  - 2024-11-07 | Im thinking if you can’t even sell during holiday and it will be harder to sell after it
  - 2024-11-07 | Because it’s holiday season so i thought it would be a great time to sell and test the product. But that’s one really frustrating 🥲
  - 2024-11-07 | Actually another product 🥹 I launched 2 weeks ago the one flagged by amz remember
  - 2024-11-05 | <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>  🥹I’m also having trouble with my product in a high competitive market. I've tested a bunch of kws, tried lowering the price, and even raised bids (which were already high), but I still can't get impressions. Do you recommend any way to fix this?😔
  - 2024-11-05 | I'll sort everything out in the document and send you a copy. I need to do more research and get ideas from other Shopify stores. Thank you so much for your advice, Susan.🫶
  - 2024-11-02 | Hi Susan, so how does it work? I thoguht we just send the product over and they will take picture of it? I am not sure how many pics do we need for shopify?
  - 2024-10-31 | If you could recommend someone to help set up Shopify, I would really appreciate it🥹 . I have a list of how I want Shopify to look and function ready. I've tried to create a Shopify store for a while, but I'm not good at it and can't really handle it at the moment.
  - 2024-10-31 | Could you recommend a photographer or graphic designer at a decent price please?
  - 2024-10-30 | Thanks, Susan, for sharing the information. 
I also have one more concern. I can’t create a Facebook account at the moment, but I have TikTok and Instagram. Does this affect my Shopify store, since I am trying link them all together? I’d appreciate your opinion.
Moreover, I don’t have good product images, so do we need to hire a listing agent to start everything over again? 
Thank you everyone🙏🏼
  - 2024-10-29 | Thank you Han 🥲
  - 2024-10-29 | Hi ,
In the past, I had a product violation, and Amazon requested FDA doc which I didn’t have, so I deleted the listing. I’ve been contacting customer service to remove the violation, becuz there’s  I already deleted the listing so nothing I can do. They told me to wait 180 days for the violation to go away. However, I keep seeing the banner “Your account is at risk of deactivation,” really bugging me. Is there anything else I can do to fix or remove the violation?
  - 2024-10-22 | <@536075832658231299> i'm stuck again
  - 2024-10-22 | Actually I tried to create FB account and link IG. They asked for selfie verification, funny is they don't take my selfie picture,  banner showed ERROR, TRY AGAIN
  - 2024-10-21 | Sorry dumb question, but do you separate or link them together your brand/theme page and personal account on both IG and FB? I lost all my IG accounts—both personal and brand/theme—so I'm trying to create a new one and figure out the right way to do it. I'm still trying to contact FB customer service to recover my account, but I haven’t received any response. I know that for FB, you must have a phone number to create an account- for IG I’m not sure. So do you also link your IG and FB accounts, or do you keep each account separate? Because if one account gets suspended, all the accounts linked to it will also be suspended.
  - 2024-10-21 | The customer service still trying to solve it. They don’t know the reason either. But I looked up on amaz forum, other sellers also have same problem. But I’m not going to lower the price for now. I don’t have much stock left. Just want to fix the problem before I run coupon for upcoming holiday
  - 2024-10-20 | For some reason, my ASIN has been suppressed due to a price discount issue. Customer service first asked me to increase the coupon discount to at least 15% and lower the listing price by 15% for the coupon to be eligible. This doesn’t make sense, as I haven’t changed the listing price since I launched, and I occasionally create coupons but have never had the discount suppressed before. Anyone know how to fix this?🙏
  - 2024-10-13 | I will do it when  get my accounts back 🥹
  - 2024-10-13 | Then I will 1 tmr. Thank you Han🙏🏼
  - 2024-10-13 | Is it the only way 🥲
  - 2024-10-13 | I tried and i can’t. I only have 1 phoen number
  - 2024-10-13 | So what’s I’m gonna do <@536075832658231299> 🥲
  - 2024-10-13 | Well, a post on IG was doesn't follow the rule so all accounts got suspended😬
  - 2024-10-12 | My personal FB and IG, theme page and brand page- all got banned🥲 so I tried to creat new FB but I don’t have  different phone number to create one
  - 2024-10-12 | I have contacted customer service and appealed the case. The issue should be resolved in seven days, but it’s been over a week already. I tried to create a new Facebook account, but I only have one phone number. When I try to create a new account, that number links back to my old account, so I can’t create a new one. Is there any other way?
  - 2024-10-12 | All my social accounts (FB and IG) were suspended last week. I already submitted an appeal, but it seems the accounts won’t be reactivated soon. My ManyChat is also not working. I tried to create another FB account, but they won’t allow it since my phone number matches the other account. Is there another way to reactivate ManyChat?
  - 2024-10-22 | Looking for an accountable partner post-launch. Flexible with time, easy to talk to. DM if interested. 🤗
  - 2024-11-09 | ❤️❤️❤️❤️Omg thank you <@1213271303327453305> I have been looking for this. It’s a huge help 💋💋💋

  - 2024-11-04 | 5 quick suggestion for new launchers? What are the 5 mist important things we should be taking care of before we go for our first launch?
  - 2024-11-03 | Before the launch
  - 2024-11-03 | Can anyone tell me how much earlier should I start promoting my brand via social media?
  - 2024-10-31 | Thanks <@1054411267340763216>
  - 2024-10-31 | Hi Sifu fam! Does supplier give us the Conner protectors in the boxes that they ship to us or we have to buy it and give it to them before shipping? 

 The plastic pieces placed in the corners of a box for shipping are commonly referred to as corner protectors or corner guards. They are used to reinforce the corners of the box and protect its contents from damage during transit.

  - 2024-10-21 | What glitches have you seen?
  - 2023-12-28 | I won’t be able to make it this Sunday because I have work.
  - 2023-11-26 | It was very fun and a good experience! Can’t wait for the next one! It’s a good reminder of how blessed we are.
  - 2023-11-26 | Haha yes, my first experience was scary.
  - 2024-10-21 | okay, thank you!
  - 2024-10-21 | Hey <@536075832658231299>, the PPC is the PPC assistant form right?
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, thank you for yalls help! Gotta head back to work
  - 2024-10-11 | I just sent a polite email stating feedback edits because he said what edits do I want from this morning. He said "people get the jest of the product from what I showed, and if i add anymore stuff it'll drop my audiences retention and views.
  - 2024-10-11 | I mean he had a list of things to highlight, because this is a paid one. He highlighted nothing and mentioned incorrect information on the video! He didn't mention one thing and says on the video "I'm not going to connect that right now because I don't have time"
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | he doesnt even have the correct stuff while talking about it
  - 2024-10-11 | yea the post is so crappy haha, we had told him what to feature and he did none put just pretty much plugged it in and turned it on. Then showed my bundles
  - 2024-10-11 | haha yeah
  - 2024-10-11 | im just so annoyed of him
  - 2024-10-11 | We also gave him the option to opt out when we had to update the software, he said he will wait.
  - 2024-10-11 | I'm going to send this to him because he's being childish and had several emails today stating how hard he has worked. And he said its been sitting in his draft box since Tuesday and just forgot to send till this morning. Lies. 

We apologize for the initial pause in production due to the software update, and we appreciate your patience in waiting for the new version to arrive. However, despite the agreed-upon deliverable dates, there have been ongoing delays. We understand that you sent the video this morning after we had already communicated our decision to part ways and requested a refund. Although you mentioned the video was recorded earlier in September, the timestamp on our product, which displays real-time, shows today's date, 10/11/24. We will accept this video and conclude our sponsorship following its submission. Thank you for your time, and we wish you the best in your future endeavors.
  - 2024-10-11 | thank you both for your inputs, ppl are shitty haha
  - 2024-10-11 | okay, yeah makes sense
  - 2024-10-11 | haha
  - 2024-10-11 | yeah, that's what im afraid of
  - 2024-10-11 | or have people buy and post lots of 1 review
  - 2024-10-11 | hahah
  - 2024-10-11 | i dont like him either haha, that's why i wanted to dispute but he seems childish and I dont want backlash
  - 2024-10-11 | Just wanted to see if you advice disputing or taking a loss to prevent backlash? Has this happened to you before?
  - 2024-10-11 | and he keeps emailing saying he wont refund becuase he put so much work into this
  - 2024-10-11 | I sent the request for refund to keep it cordial and he sent a crappy video this morning. He said we wont refund because he has spent hours and hours working on this. My device on the video shows a time stamped he recorded it this morning
  - 2024-10-11 | service
  - 2024-10-11 | Help! Wanted to ask for any advice on this situation Im currently experiencing. I have an influencer I'm working with, paid a deposit already. He was suppose to post a video in august and he kept delaying and not responding. He finally responded in sept when we asked to part ways and get a refund. He said his technician has been on vacation and he couldn't get the recordings done and will be able to have it done be 9/20. 9/21 came and he delayed it again. Multiple follow ups every other day and no response. Yesterday we sent another letter to part ways due to it past deadline again and he said he will send it today at noon. I still wanted to part ways bc its past my prime day and wanted it before then. He got upset and said he is not refunding something hes spent hours and hours on. He sent a video this morning and the time stamp shows he recorded it this morning and sent it to me 30 mins after he finished recording. I sent a refund request and he denied it even though the video is terrible. Would you still file a dispute on paypal or take a loss?

  - 2024-11-11 | What are your top 3 goals this week for your business?
- I need to get my 5 FBM reviews on my listing
- Get my PPC Keyword Research approved by Han
- Schedule meeting with Justing and Han to go over strategy so I can launch later this week or early next week.
How long will it take?
- FBM Reviews- 1-2 days (not sure how long it will take to load onto my listing)
- PPC Keyword Research (already sent to shifu Han, need to do any adjustments afterwards. Maybe 3-4 days)
- Schedule meeting (5-6 days)
What is your due date for it?
- 6 Days (Sunday)
What support processes do you need to make that happen?
- Stay consistant every morning keeping up on developments and updates so I am not falling behind 2-3 days at a time
  - 2024-11-12 | January on a weekend would work best for me.
  - 2024-11-12 | I am trying to figure out what videos I want on my listing and am stuck between getting someone to do an unboxing or hiring someone to do an actual product video with voiceover and music. Has anyone had better success with one or the other? I am a little skeptical to spend too much because there are some changes I want to make in my next shipment including the design of the box so I will probably end up having to redue some of the listing videos. I am leaning towards doing a product review without the box in it because then I can use the video even after I update the packaging.
  - 2024-11-13 | My top 2 today:
1. Figure out who can create a video for me on Fiver and schedule it.
2. Schedule class with Han regarding PPC
  - 2024-11-13 | nevermind, susan let me know she was the one who looked at my keyword research. Thought that was you Han. Sorry about that. Ill see you on Friday for our 1 on 1 meeting. Thanks.
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi Han, I submitted my PPC keyword analysis and got the attached email back with no coaching comments. Did you or someone else get a chance to look at this? I am going to schedule a 1 on 1 meeting in your calendar. I have my 5 reviews made just waiting for them to load onto my account so I believe my listing is ready for launch besides the video I still need. Thanks, and have a good night.
  - 2024-11-11 | I apologize. I was out of town in North Carolina for work the last 6 days and didn't have much access to discord or work on my product at all. I just sent Han my PPC Keyword research and am going to schedule a call once I get my 5 FBM review loaded onto my listing. I will try to keep up on the homework this week.

  - 2024-10-25 | all good thank u
  - 2024-10-25 | i tried just the 725-210-7249 but it wont let me either
  - 2024-10-25 | Hi <@536075832658231299> it wont let me schedule a meeting wd u. the phone number Im trying to key in says invalid but this is the number Im using. 

Phone no: 725-210-7249.
  - 2024-10-16 | I'm just really afraid that if we change anything in the listing may mess up what we currently have and will have to go through the review process again... but pls let me know if u think otherwise. thank u
  - 2024-10-16 | Is the deep link mandatory? since we're not hiring freelancers to do the reviews. But instead, we'll have maybe 2 or 3 of our staff make the purchase and then reimbursed and will do the reviews
  - 2024-10-16 | 
  - 2024-10-16 | my concern is that if I do that, I'm afraid it'll mess up the previous data we have for the listing and may lead to another listing review.
  - 2024-10-16 | Hello <@1066465177140215928> I tried changing the product title but it won't give me the option to just change the title b/c it prompts us to update the whole listing.
  - 2024-10-16 | Thanks Han. I was trying to create a deeplink using this link which incl our ASIN but not getting any results  -- https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thermal+label+printer&hidden-keywords=[B0D937HW3R]&ref=nb_sb_noss_1
  - 2024-10-15 | Good morning @everyonecould I get your thoughts on the above please? Thank u
  - 2024-10-14 | My IP address is already registered with our Seller Central account. Im just afraid that it will create an issue or red flag if I create a deeplink using the same device, considering that I am located in the Philippines and not in the US?
  - 2024-10-14 | Q2: re: the creation of deeplink. 

the instructions said that it was meant for a freelancer through Upwork... Is it okay to create deeplink acct using the same device, IP address and email we use for our Seller acct,
  - 2024-10-14 | and so I was wondering if its possible or better if I just copy the listing and then add another condition then set up fbm
  - 2024-10-14 | Hello @everyone, could I pls get ur thoughts on this-- I notice that whenever we click on add another condition and set up an fbm... the listing changes from fba to fbm

Reported another VP review from competitors. They use the same tactic, first upload a 4 stars review with a picture of another similar product. When it’s published, they will change it to 1 star then delete the picture. Same tactic. Also being super busy with my baby as she is having diarrhea and fever this week. The fever is no more but the diarrhea it’s still on. I am closely communicating with her doctor because we don’t want her to be dehydrated. It’s painful to see her in pain. Wishing tomorrow she can get better. 
This week I was able to accomplish all my goals except for having one more organic review from customer😭 I guess I have to reward myself with 50 squats
  - 2024-11-15 | November 15, 2024
Thank God! I was waiting for this payment so I could order second batch😭😭 really grateful for this, I don’t have a lot of profit from this batch but it’s okay for now as long as I rank myself and get the reviews
  - 2024-11-14 | Chloe what’s 3PL? Thank you it does feel good to know that!
  - 2024-11-13 | November 13, 2024 
Happy to say that I completely filled out a notebook with important tips and lessons from the vault and classes since the beginning. Had to buy another for my journey post launch. I am not selling any notebook not even for 1 billion dollars so don’t ask 😂
Goals of the week
1. Optimized many chat flow. After it, got another one organic review  from customer. Working on to get one more to reach my goal of 2-4 a week by following up with customers ✅
2. Already have 6 f&f and mentees that bought altogether for future fbm reviews for this week✅
3. Optimize ppc for today 
4. Created YouTube brand channel. Posted 4 vertical shorts✅
5. Pending to create separate listing. Will do it by end of week
  - 2024-11-12 | It means I should create a new listing with a different ASIN in case I can’t save my current one if I keep on getting targeted
  - 2024-11-12 | November 12, 2024 
This past week I have been bombarded with bad reviews from competitors but it’s okay this is part of the journey. Had a call with shifu Justin to help me clear my mind and give me better insights on what to improve and strategies advices. These are the key points, goals and mindsets I have set for myself. Hope this may also be helpful for others on the same stage 🙏
  - 2024-11-09 | November 9, 2024
These past few days I have been bombarded with a lot of bad reviews from my competition. I filed and reported this but Amazon is not doing anything about it. It’s really saddening because I am working really  hard for this and even earned Amazons choice badge  but my sales are hurting because of the almost daily  bad reviews . Today I received a 1 star review from a verified purchase but it’s the competition because they first uploaded a wrong review 4 star review with a picture of another product later after an hour they changed it to 1 star and removed the picture and the description doesn’t match my product even though it’s a verified purchase…
  - 2024-11-06 | Thank you , I will look into when I got  the chance
  - 2024-11-06 | Yes please
  - 2024-11-06 | November 6, 2024
My top goals for the week and my progress 
1. Put in 2-3 fbm reviews = 5-7 fbm sales. Goal for a month.
had two friends who bought my product a few months ago leave reviews. Also have 4 fbm sales for future reviews ✅
2. Continue monitoring my sales and my competitors sales to know the average.  So I can know what’s the average everyone is doing and if I am velo or above average I can adjust my focus. Certainly from the data , I can sell more units but the bad reviews from competitors are taking a bad effect on my listing 
3. Make 2 new reels for my IG. Weekly goal. Made 3 new reels already ✅

Apart from my 2 friends leaving reviews, I got 2 organic reviews which made my day. Keep reminding me everything is worth it for the long run. 

For all launching members I seriously encourage you to work on your fbm reviews. So you can be prepared for the review battle
  - 2024-11-06 | What was this app? I need to try it 🤩
  - 2024-11-05 | November 4, 2024 
I am thankful for  <@975774205658411068>  and other mentees I was mentally prepared for bad reviews that are trying to sabotage my listing. In the past I will just stress about it and focus all my energy on things I can’t control. But today I just took it like a challenge everyone will go through when doing business and my job is to always prepare for everything. So today I got reminded that I need to prioritize fbm reviews, then the other things (important as well just that if my listing looking bad with those reviews then no one will buy, no sales=no organic reviews=high acos)

Woke up with 4 two stars reviews from non verified purchases, all from the same day, all have bad reviews on me and other competitors products and have good reviews on the same products of other brands. Can I report this ? It’s obvious it’s fake reviews. But it did have impact on my sales because normally I will have 1-2 sales when I wake up, but today I got none. I was focusing on gaining reviews and sales, but part of the reviews I need to get are also from fbm, so I will keep that in mind and continue improving
  - 2024-11-02 | November 1, 2024 
Began module 6, working on influencer marketing and emails for reviews. My top priorities are getting as much reviews as possible and driving organic sales. Also preparing for second batch order. Right now I am sacrificing profits so I can move inventory and maybe getting 10 reviews per month which means 2.5 review per week starting this month (don’t know if it’s too much or not but for now it’s the goal) even though I am sacrificing profits and wondering if it’s a good choice, today I got a customer to leave a review (well I will never know if they actually did leave the review until it’s published) so if they did , its a good reminder that everything is for the long run👍🏻
  - 2024-10-28 | Goal1: optimize PPC 
Goal2: put ads on Instagram reel 
Goal3: do one fbm review 
Everything for this week
  - 2024-10-28 | Daily update, omg the customer did leave a product review !!!!!🔥🔥
  - 2024-10-27 | October 26, 2024
Got a customer to scan the QR code but she did not press the button for review  but she did send a picture of the review (but not being submitted) I also checked her order id and in fact it’s a customer but there is no feedback submitted and her email have a really sketchy email🧐 so I think I will wait for a couple of days to see if it’s really submitted if not maybe message her.

  - 2024-10-28 | Goal1: optimize PPC 
Goal2: put ads on Instagram reel 
Goal3: do one fbm review 
Everything for this week
  - 2024-10-28 | Daily update, omg the customer did leave a product review !!!!!🔥🔥
  - 2024-10-27 | October 26, 2024
Got a customer to scan the QR code but she did not press the button for review  but she did send a picture of the review (but not being submitted) I also checked her order id and in fact it’s a customer but there is no feedback submitted and her email have a really sketchy email🧐 so I think I will wait for a couple of days to see if it’s really submitted if not maybe message her.

I am thankful for  <@975774205658411068>  and other mentees I was mentally prepared for bad reviews that are trying to sabotage my listing. In the past I will just stress about it and focus all my energy on things I can’t control. But today I just took it like a challenge everyone will go through when doing business and my job is to always prepare for everything. So today I got reminded that I need to prioritize fbm reviews, then the other things (important as well just that if my listing looking bad with those reviews then no one will buy, no sales=no organic reviews=high acos) 
My top goals for the week 
1. Put in 2-3 fbm reviews = 5-7 fbm sales. Goal for a month 
2. Continue monitoring my sales and my competitors sales to know the average.  So I can know what’s the average everyone is doing and if I am velo or above average I can adjust my focus 
3. Make 2 new reels for my IG. Weekly goal
  - 2024-11-04 | Yes I just did, will wait if they remove them
  - 2024-11-04 | November 4, 2024 
Woke up with 4 two stars reviews from non verified purchases, all from the same day, all have bad reviews on me and other competitors products and have good reviews on the same products of other brands. Can I report this ? It’s obvious it’s fake reviews. But it did have impact on my sales because normally I will have 1-2 sales when I wake up, but today I got none. I was focusing on gaining reviews and sales, but part of the reviews I need to get are also from fbm, so I will keep that in mind and continue improving

  - 2024-11-08 | I am simultaneously doing fbm reviews and fba, for my F&F can they leave reviews more often instead of 50% since there are sales on fba to make it look like not everyone is leaving reviews ?

  - 2024-11-01 | Welcome guys 🔥🔥
  - 2024-10-04 | 😂😂😂
  - 2024-11-16 | I should do that too😂😂😂
  - 2024-11-16 | Wow congrats 🎉 that’s the best feeling ever 🔥🔥
  - 2024-11-15 | Thank you ❤️
  - 2024-11-15 | I reported the reviews in the reviews sections and also opened a case on seller central
  - 2024-11-15 | So I highly recommend you to read the guideline so you can protect  yourself
  - 2024-11-15 | So from the 5 reviews, 4 were unverified and 1 was a verified purchase. 
Depending on what they wrote, I read the whole violation guidelines and used that as my reference  of their violation and screenshots of the review and their review history as my evidence. For example, the verified purchase was mentioning about an attribute my product did not have. Also they uploaded a picture of another product then removed them from the review. Luckily I took screenshots of the before and after and evidently it was violating like 2 statements from the guideline. Not to mention, with the help of chat gpt I wrote a long and detailed explanation of everything and our it nicely in a document so it was easy to understand for anyone reading it.
  - 2024-11-15 | Win22: today I got 5 bad reviews removed from my listing (from the competitors). Even though it’s a win, I am feeling uneasy as they may start adding more anytime…
  - 2024-11-14 | Shifu what’s the difference between “ adding variation”and adding “another condition”
  - 2024-11-14 | Oh wow nice tip 🔥 thank you shifu 🙏
  - 2024-11-14 | Nice tip btw !
  - 2024-11-14 | Wow nice !!! I also enroll on Amazon vine reviews but I read the max reviews it’s 30, so I already have 28 reviews , so I can  enroll only 2 products 🥲
  - 2024-11-11 | Win21: talked to a really nice customer that scanned my QR code about how she was doing with her new product, she replied great , that she loves the product and I followed by offering an incentive for the review, storytelling about my business and she was more than happy to help ! She even uploaded a video of the product❤️🔥🔥 so everyone take care of you customers they are willing to help you as long as you can connect with them and show them you genuinely care to help them. 

This is a great tip shifu Justin gave me as I am struggling with competitors bombarding me with bad reviews to slow me down. So again, take care of your customers. They are your key for success
  - 2024-11-11 | Woohooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀
  - 2024-11-09 | Yesssssss congratulations 🚀🚀🚀🚀
  - 2024-11-08 | Yes thank you shifu🙏 I will work on that continuously
  - 2024-11-07 | True story: so I got Amazons choice yesterday midnight and I was going to leverage it on social media today morning, but then I got a plain 1 star review when I checked this morning, I will assume it’s from a competitor because the timing it’s too great and I strongly believe in the quality of my product. So now I got strip off the badge😭😭
Everyone on launching stage, I strongly advice you to work on your fbm reviews as many as you can before launching. Competitors will do anything to sabotage you

  - 2024-10-14 | Ok so I will have to have friends keep on buying from fbm
  - 2024-10-14 | So I should have 1 unit for FBM at 30% higher price ?
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-22 | I am newly launched but sure I will help where I can
  - 2024-10-22 | Hey I am also en ENFP🔥🔥
  - 2024-11-12 | My top 2:
1. work on YouTube shorts 
2. Gathering fbm reviews
  - 2024-11-12 | There is PPC hw4??? Where can I find it 😭
  - 2024-11-07 | 1. Sent gift card for customer leaving review 
2. Answered customer email for help
  - 2024-11-15 | TikTok
  - 2024-11-06 | Is there any other way for this ? I can’t put -20% discount
  - 2024-11-03 | If my status for back Friday event is “scheduled” does it means it’s active ? Also just to make sure the minimum discount should be 5%? (It’s not the amount I am offering but just to know the numbers)
  - 2024-11-03 | yes, try using google chrome or another browser
  - 2024-11-03 | Thank you Susan 🙏
  - 2024-11-03 | Han is there a tutorial on how to do it ? I didn’t got the chance for prime day so I am not sure how to do it correctly
  - 2024-11-02 | Did you try that method ?
  - 2024-11-02 | Hahahahha
  - 2024-11-02 | Emmmmmmmmmmm got me thinking
  - 2024-11-02 | What I see is that they do leave the higher price up and sell some units but mostly they keep on making the limited deal
  - 2024-11-02 | I just got an idea: isn’t better to list our selling price high, then run limited time deals so We will be in the limited deal category, have the limited badge and wont  need to increase the price just keep on running deals. Can someone give me opinions on this ? Thoughts, pros and cons I may be missing?
  - 2024-11-01 | Yes , a lot of impressions and a lot of clicks
  - 2024-11-01 | Today I noticed that my auto campaign is not making orders , could it mean that another seller is bidding higher ? Normally this campaign will have good sales always
  - 2024-11-01 | Yeah need to work on that
  - 2024-11-01 | Wow then I donated a lot to the cause
  - 2024-11-01 | 😂😂😂😂😂😂
  - 2024-11-01 | So everyone will have to pay in the beginning since payouts are bi weekly 😭😭
  - 2024-11-01 | Hello everyone, I am wondering why did Amazon charged me for ads , i thought it will be deducted from the pay outs ?

  - 2024-11-12 | Today is November 11, or 11/11, referred to by some mystics as the Gateway time of the year when a doorway opens to the divine and our manifestation powers go into high gear. So at exactly 11:11 pm is believed to be a good time to set an intention for things that you want to manifest in your life. Get a cup of water , paper and pen , a lighter and a candle . Write all you want  and read it out to manifest it .

  - 2024-11-15 | I submitted my weekly homework today and I'm so happy so see the profit that I've made in just one week. It's more than what I make at my 9-5 in 2 weeks. I'm so blessed to meet everyone that I have on here as well as charity works I have done with the team. Grateful for everything ❤️ 🫶
  - 2024-11-09 | thank you justin!
  - 2024-11-09 | So this is my 2nd week of launching and sales are up and down. Very very slow after the elections but hope it picks back up for black friday 😢  I'm learning to optimize PPC and my units are missing which im very stressed about!!
  - 2024-10-26 | I just launched a couple of days ago and sales are super slow. I'm still learning about PPC and improving my listing and reviews. UGH but it does tug on your emotions when you are really expecting a flow, but I know good things take time so prayers!!! 🙏

  - 2024-11-15 | for returns, should I choose to offer free returns on my product?
  - 2024-11-12 | I believe that I have...I'm not sure if it's right though
  - 2024-11-09 | thank you!!
  - 2024-11-09 | If the returned item is considered unfillable, can we have it shipped back to us?
  - 2024-11-09 | let me send it to you separately
  - 2024-11-09 | hey guys, for returns, do I have to click refund order on seller central or is it automatic from Amazon? Also what happens to the returned item?
  - 2024-11-08 | review section 🥹
  - 2024-11-08 | does anyone know why my video reviews keep getting removed? I got 2 video reviews removed already!!
  - 2024-11-07 | individual right?
  - 2024-11-07 | is our tax clarification count as individual or business?
  - 2024-11-07 | ok thanks guys! I'm currrently chatting with Amazon to resolve it. I lost 1 full carton of product!
  - 2024-11-07 | has anyone had units that went missing in the shipment or in amazon warehouse
  - 2024-11-05 | when setting up for black friday, is the minimum discount price and the prime discount price different?
  - 2024-11-05 | ok got it, thank you guys!
  - 2024-11-05 | If the customer's order is taking longer than 2 days to process and approved. Is that on our end or amazon? I have 2 orders that are still pending.
  - 2024-11-03 | If my ACOS for auto campaign doesn't show, does that mean it's still too early for optimiziation?
  - 2024-10-30 | For reviews, if the person submitted their review already but it's not showing on my listing yet. Does that count as 1 review or can I have another person review in the meantime? I'm scared it's gonna be considered as the reviews are close together
  - 2024-10-30 | I got it reimbursed! hehe
  - 2024-10-30 | does that sound accurate?
  - 2024-10-30 | That's weird cause she's saying that it's divided to not be more than $39.99
  - 2024-10-30 | I thought if we disabled CA and MX then it will not be charged?
  - 2024-10-30 | I'm talking to Amazon  Support about my issue with the charges to Canada and Mexico. She said this "Kindly note that with a north American unified account the subscription fee is split charged which means it is divided across the marketplaces (US, CA and MX) and it will not be more than $ 39.99"
  - 2024-10-30 | thanks An!

  - 2024-07-04 | 
  - 2024-05-22 | That's all I see
  - 2024-05-22 | Is the PIR only for Texas?
  - 2024-05-22 | I'm sorry I may have forgotten, we have to file a BOI and another document which I don't remember which it was. I already filed my BOI but I remember there's another one, I just don't remember the name of it
  - 2024-05-18 | Thank you Minh!!
  - 2024-05-16 | hey Minh! Did you find out yet? 🙂
  - 2024-05-14 | Hi! I have a question regarding BOI. For the company applicant and beneficial owner tabs, do I file my name twice? I watched Charlie’s video but I’m a bit confused on that
  - 2024-10-30 | should I wait 2 weeks for data before lowering my price? Sales are slow

  - 2024-11-14 | I can’t access the link 🥹
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you Jamie!
  - 2024-11-12 | No worries it wasn’t your fault! I think it was Amazon removing “violated” posts 🥹
  - 2024-11-12 | I have no clue why it was removed 🥲
  - 2024-11-12 | It was Louis and Khoa
  - 2024-11-09 | was there any violations in these reviews?
  - 2024-11-09 | with videos
  - 2024-11-09 | 2. Tagline: Great product great price. = I went camping with one of my friends and they had one similar to this one. After receiving this product, I can tell that it is much higher quality and I love it so much already. I tried all the features and function and it was great. Definitely 10/10!!!
  - 2024-11-09 | 1. Tagline: Perfect for Security and Peace of Mind = Working the graveyard shift as a security guard, I bought these to use at night. I've tried other brands, but Virtual Haven's goggles are by far the best. The images are sharp, and the IR illuminator works flawlessly even in complete darkness. These goggles are well-built and rugged, which is a huge plus since I often work in harsh weather conditions. The battery life is excellent, lasting through my entire shift.
  - 2024-11-09 | Can you guys help me review my reviews and why were they taken down?
  - 2024-11-09 | thanks han!
  - 2024-11-07 | please let me know if I'm doing them correctly
  - 2024-11-07 | I turned in the inventory management hw and data visibility hw!
  - 2024-11-07 | Yes I actually do need some help with PPC. I reached out to Louis for help but if I can get help from you that would be great too!
  - 2024-11-03 | is the price im selling right now, I would put in the minimum price box?

  - 2024-10-28 | oh like the red color for the screen?
  - 2024-10-28 | Ok I’ll  bring the idea to Susan
  - 2024-10-28 | ohhhh I see

- get my FBM purchases mailed out (done ✅)
- try to fix my listing by contacting Amazon help. If that doesn’t work, then re-list my product
-  continue looking for my second product

Hopefully my listing issue will be able to be fixed without having to re-list it. Just waiting on Amazon to get back to me now. If I need to re-list it, I will probably have to reach out to Han in order to do it successfully. 

Other than that, I am on the constant search for my next replacement product now
  - 2024-11-01 | This is awesome, thanks Olesia!
  - 2024-10-28 | 1.) Try and finish homework and mail out FBM reviews
2.)  At end of week
3.)  If required, I will reach out to Han or fellow mentees for assistance

Was it example 10 from our previous homework assignment that you want us to answer those questions with?

  - 2024-02-15 | Probably just cause LegalZoom is kinda sketchy with how they present their services. A lot of their add ons when intiailly signed up for an LLC could be done for free or optional lol
But this sounds like one of those services that's worth spending money on to save you time. good suggestion, <@1112578451816321157>

  - 2024-02-02 | Thank you brother. They are a big part of my "why"
  - 2024-02-02 | Hi Edward. I don't live in Philippines but the charity work I do is out there.
  - 2024-01-31 | 
  - 2024-01-31 | Hi All! Today is the last day of our official fundraiser. We didn't hit our goal, but we made some good progress. And I am super appreciative of the Shifu Family. Y'all donated half of what was raised, so super thank you to you all! And thank you to the Shifu's for allowing me this platform to share. Also,  I wanted to share the winners of a drawing contest I held for January. The kids' age ranged from 6-20 that participated. Here are the 1st and 2nd place winners in each age group. 1st place won 1000pesos = $18 and 2nd place won 300pesos= $5.50. Not huge prizes in regards to U.S. dollars, but in pesos, that's significant. These prizes were personally funded by me and doesn't come out of the donated funds from the GoFundMe fundraiser. I will continue to keep the fundraiser active should anyone else like to donate in the future, but I won't be soliciting on here anymore out of respect of other charity initiatives.  https://gofund.me/bca9ef76 . Thank you all!
  - 2024-01-27 | Here's a quick update on our tutoring hall. We are installing our railing leading to the tutoring hall today. It's the last piece of the facility to be installed. Thank you to those who donated. We still are hoping to hit our $5k by next month, but if not, we will still make things happen. The kids are worth it. Thank you for letting me share.
  - 2024-01-24 | Some of the kids that will be attending our tutoring hall wanted to say Thank You to our donors and future donors. You're making a huge difference.
  - 2024-01-22 | Here's a short video of our kids starting to use the hall for a drawing contest I've created for them. They are so excited to use the room and the supplies we have. Most of their classrooms are packed with 50+ kids in a room with no Air Conditioning. Right now we can only afford fans but that's fine for now. It will get warmer during the summer. We focus primarily on kids that can't afford to go to school or struggle to keep up with their lessons. The education system there tends to push kids into the next grade even if they aren't understanding well. This is why we have 7th graders here that still struggle to read or write. And parents are encouraged to teach their kids what their teachers don't, however, they don't know how to read or write themselves. So we hope this will be a beacon of hope for the kids in our village to have a proper education so they can have a chance to prosper.
  - 2024-01-22 | Quick update. Thanks everyone who has donated so far. We raised enough funds for a printer and paper! Here's my mom with our new printer. I'm very grateful to have her help since I run all purchases through her since she's there. We will now be able to print out handouts, enrollment forms, and other learning material for the kids. Thank you!
  - 2024-01-22 | 
  - 2024-01-22 | Thank you Shifu Family for donating to the charity work we are doing in the Philippines. Thank you to Susan Hang, Linh Doan, Joan Lovelle Alfeche, Davis Truong, Michael Lee and Phuong Nguyen for donating so far! You've gotten us even closer to our goal. Our fundraiser is still going until February, so if you'd still like to contribute, please visit our GoFundMe link. We now have enough funds to buy a printer and some school supplies, so your money is already being put to great use. 🙂 . https://gofund.me/bca9ef76

I treated them like friends, and now they treat me very well and have been a huge help during my listing deactivation. Just wanted to share my experience. 😁

  - 2024-11-11 | Top 3 Goals
  - 2024-11-10 | It’s been a challenging time, balancing the stress of family issues along with the demands of my Amazon business. Family matters have been a big distraction from this journey—I’m doing this for them, yet my mom doesn’t quite see the value in what I’m pursuing. And as a mom to a teenage daughter, I’m constantly trying to be a mentor for her, even though she thinks she already knows everything and doesn’t feel she needs my guidance. I know it’s part of her growing up, but it can be frustrating, especially with everything else I’m juggling. Still, I’m pushing forward, hoping to set an example of resilience and dedication.

On a positive note, I reached my goal this week of collaborating with a few shoppable influencers. If they post on time, I should have more review content for my listing, which I’m hoping will help boost conversions. My sales even started to pick up a little bit yesterday, so I’m hoping things will keep improving with everything I’m putting into it. I’ve also finalized the updates for my packaging inserts. Right now, I’m working through module 6, and my goal for next week is to complete all the lessons in this module and continue to focus learning and optimizing PPC .
  - 2024-11-06 | My Goals for This Week:
1. Create new content for both IG product and theme pages.
2. Find influencers and set up collaborations for more shoppable videos on our Amazon listing.
3. Develop the quick user guide, updated manual, and ebook project ready to go.
4. Work with the sourcing agent on better packaging and adding more value to the product.                                                                
Progress & Deadlines:
Shoppable Videos & Influencer Partnerships: My primary goal with shoppable videos is to increase conversion rates ahead of Black Friday and the holiday season, with a deadline of 11/20. For social media influencers, my focus is on building brand awareness.
IG Content Creation: Adding fresh content to both product and theme pages on IG this week.                                                             
Product Development: By Sunday, aiming to finish the quick user guide, updated manual, and  finalize the ebook project. Also working with the sourcing agent to improve packaging and explore better quality add-ons for the product.

  - 2024-11-01 | The first month of launching my  has been a blend of excitement, challenge, and growth. By the two week mark, I felt a wave of worry. Sales were slower than expected, and ACoS costs were significantly higher than my target. It was overwhelming to see ad costs that high, and I began to question if I could really make this work. However, after optimizing my PPC campaigns, creating test campaigns, and manually adding new ASIN to  target, I started to see steady, encour aging growth.
Thanks to Shifu Han's load of homeworks. Entering information into the Data Visibility Sheets gave me clarity on performance trends and helped pinpoint areas needing improvement. This visibility, along with my efforts in PPC, was key in turning things around.
Despite these wins, I did encounter some challenges. Three returns impacted revenue and profit margins. I had  to investigate the causes. Thankfully, none were due to product quality, which reassured me that the product is resonating with customersPPC optimization remain a focus. I’m also working on influencer marketing, experimenting with guerrilla marketing tactics to drive brand awareness and sales.
This first month has been a great learning experience. I’m happy with the small wins and am comitted to refining my strategies and metrics. It’s just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep pushing forward on this journey.

  - 2024-11-07 | Yes, this happened to me as well! To resolve it, I had to send Amazon the supplier's invoice, which prompted them to start an investigation. Fortunately, they found the missing units. Otherwise, they might have simply labeled the shipment as having a discrepancy, and that would be the end of it.

  - 2024-09-23 | Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings after 9 AM PST work for me.
  - 2024-09-19 | I’m also working with Elinor, and when it comes to shipping, she connected me with Mia, their shipping agent. For my bulk order, the shipment from the supplier to the shipping agent was done by truck, and they only provided a reference number. However, once Mia arranged the shipment to Amazon, she gave me five tracking numbers for the different warehouses. I then went to ups.com to enter those tracking numbers and get the tracking number for each carton.
  - 2024-11-06 | My average CPC is out here living the high life at $4! My budget’s tapped out before lunch, PPC spend doubled from Friday to Sunday, and guess what? No sales...because my competitor decided to throw a limited-time deal party. But hey, things chilled out yesterday, and I finally snagged a sale! 😆
  - 2024-10-19 | thank you, Shifu!
  - 2024-10-19 | thank you, Shifu!
  - 2024-10-19 | thank you, Shifu!
  - 2024-10-19 | thank you, Shifu!
  - 2024-10-24 | Thanks Han! That's what I'm trying to figure out is how I can determine the next bid according to the recorded data. Is it too new to see the pattern?
  - 2024-10-24 | Is the rule for setting a new bid for ASIN targets different from that for keywords? I've noticed that ASINs with no clicks have had their bids increased by 7 to 10%. If I need to set the new bid manually, how can I determine the appropriate percentage to increase it by?
  - 2024-10-24 | Could you please explain why the PPC assistant set the new bid 8% higher than the CPC for this ASIN target? <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-17 | I'm a bit confused about what the new bids should be for these two keywords. 😵‍💫 <@536075832658231299>

  - 2024-10-28 | I was just on there to ask for help on how to approach the problem—I promise I’ve been solving every example on my own! 😁
  - 2024-10-28 | if you are not sure, you can always ask chatgpt or go on youtube.
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you Jamie
  - 2024-11-11 | Okay! I'll try that
  - 2024-11-11 | 
  - 2024-11-11 | I tested it again last night and encountered the same issue. I had to upload it twice for ManyChat to acknowledge it.
  - 2024-11-11 | Hi Han! She did click on the button.
  - 2024-11-11 | I'm not sure why this issue keeps occurring with my ManyChat flow. After a customer uploads her screenshot, ManyChat still displays a message saying it hasn't been received. I’ve tested the flow several times, and it seemed to work fine, but this has now happened twice when customers have uploaded their screenshots. Each time, I had to step in, apologize, and confirm that they would receive the gift card by email.
  - 2024-11-03 | thanks
  - 2024-11-03 | okay
  - 2024-11-03 | and then adjust it again when th limited time deal is over?
  - 2024-11-03 | Do I just do a bulk adjustment to all the keywords ?
  - 2024-11-03 | Should I adjust my PPC campaign when a competitor is running a Limited Time Deal? My PPC spend is higher than usual, but I’m not seeing any sales.
  - 2024-10-28 | Thank you, Susan! Yes, I check the market every day to see if a price adjustment is needed. My pricing is slightly better than competitors’, though I’ve noticed many new sellers undercutting with lower prices. I also spoke with other mentees in the same niche, and it seems we’re all facing the same issues—high PPC costs and slow sales.
  - 2024-10-28 | I forgot to click on target before exporting. sorry! 😅
  - 2024-10-28 | I just resubmit for ppc assistant.
  - 2024-10-28 | I just submitted a request for a PPC assistant. Over the last five days, my PPC spend was only $285—below my ACOS—but sales have been slow from day one. I’m not sure if this is just a niche-wide slowdown or is it just my listing is not attracting buyers .

Right now, I’m working on driving more sales outside of Amazon through influencer marketing and to add additional video content for both my listing and social media. Is there anything else you’d recommend to help boost sales?

Thanks so much for your advice!
  - 2024-10-17 | I saw this in campaign manager for growth opportunity suggesting I could drive an estimated $2,115 in sales for my product due to increased organic clicks.  Would you recommend participating in something like this? <@1066465177140215928> <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-17 | Thanks, Susan
  - 2024-10-17 | I see
  - 2024-10-17 | Usually how do they resolve the issue?
  - 2024-10-17 | 
  - 2024-10-15 | got it! Thanks <@1066465177140215928>
  - 2024-10-15 | Thanks for checking! That’s odd, it’s still not working on my end. I’ll try testing it again or maybe use another device. Thanks Han!
  - 2024-10-15 | hmmm..
  - 2024-10-15 | 
  - 2024-10-15 | I think my QR code isn’t working—it doesn’t open Messenger when scanned. Can you help me fix it? <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-10-15 | Do you mean I should wait to see if the story is effective in increasing sales, and then, if it is, ask for the video and pay the rest?
  - 2024-10-15 | He's very active on his page which is a good thing. And he reply quickly.
  - 2024-10-15 | He agree to let me keep the video and use it on other platform but I have to pay 500 total. Still trying to negotiate with him to 300 total. 😄
  - 2024-10-15 | I forgot the % ! I will have to check later as my phone have IG app issue right now.
  - 2024-10-15 | Yes! Just 1 story slide
  - 2024-10-15 | Yes
  - 2024-10-14 | what's your thought of my reasoning? 😁
  - 2024-10-14 | Thanks so much for your feedbak! I’ve been thinking about this alot. Even though this influancer is focused on skating and most of his audience is into the same thing, I’ve noticed he hasn’t promoted health and wellness products before. Most of his sponsord posts are about skating gear. I’ve gone over all the importand factors, like his audience, engagement, and the type of content he posts.

While he doesn’t have experiance with health products, I still see potencial. Skaters are big on physical fitness and recovery, which ties in really well with what hydrogen water offes. Since they lead active lives, I think they’d appreicate something that helps with hydration, boosts energy, and aids recovery after skating. Plus, he creates engaging, fun content, and if he can showcase the product in a relatable way, like using it after a skate session, I think it could really connect with his followers.

Since it’s a smaller colaboration, I feel like it’s a good way to test the waters and see how his audience reacts. If it works out, we could explore more colaborations later on.
  - 2024-10-14 | I’ve got an influencer lined up who’s willing to do an Instagram story for $250. He’s a skater from Canada with 218K followers, and a lot of his audience is in the U.S. Do you think it’s worth it for a 24-hour story? I’m also thinking about offering his followers a exclusive coupon.
I’m considering asking if I can save the story video to use on my product page and for other marketing. Does that sound like a good idea? Would love to hear what you think!
  - 2024-10-12 | 
  - 2024-10-11 | Hi Han! I forgot to ask earlier—could you please review my ManyChat flow and let me know if you suggest any changes or improvements? Thanks so much!    https://m.me/351469744713187?ref=w26035388

  - 2024-11-15 | Hey everyone! I just wanted to share an idea that might help you drive more sale. With Black Friday and the holiday season coming up, I decided to update my main listing image with a holiday or Christmas-themed background to make it stand out more in search results. I think this could help increase clicks and sales!
Here’s how I did it using Canva:
1.  Click Create a Design.
2.  Search for “Amazon” and select Amazon product image 1080 x 1080 px.
3.  Upload your main image from your listing.
4.  Click on the image to add it to the design.
5.  Select the image and click Edit.
6.  Tap on BG Remover on the left to remove the image background.
7.  Click on Elements on the left and search for something like “Christmas present background,” “holiday background,” or “Christmas border” to see festive options.
8.  Tap on the background you want to use, and it will appear in the design.
9.  While the background is still selected, click Edit and tap BG Remover to make it white (this is required by Amazon for main images).
10.  Stretch the background to fit the design size and adjust it until you like the look.
11.  While the background is still selected, click Position.
12.  Tap Go Back to place the background behind your main image. This ensures your product stays on top and visible.
13. Adjust the image size and position as needed.
14.  Tap Share and then Download.
15.  Save the file as a PNG.
And voilà! You’re ready to upload this festive main image to your listing. Feel free to get creative with other holiday backgrounds; backgrounds with borders tend to work best!
  - 2024-11-08 | Hey everyone! I just discovered a feature on Seller Central that can benefit us all. If you have a social media page for your product, you can set up an Amazon Attribution campaign to track traffic coming from your page, ads, or even specific influencers.

Here's how it works: the campaign generates a special link you can share on your product page, social media, or with influencers. This link lets you see how much traffic each source is driving, so you can measure the effectiveness of influencer marketing and other external channels.

The best part? It’s FREE to use, and Amazon will reward you with a 10% bonus on every sale made through these links. Even better, these sales are considered organic, which can help boost your product’s ranking. The 10% bonus is applied as a reduction on your referral fees two months after the sale.

Learn more about the Brand Referral Bonus program here: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/brand-referral-bonus

  - 2024-11-04 | Amazon offer it to me through email. And it's also show on the main page of seller central.
  - 2024-11-03 | I got an offer for display ads too! Definitely going to take this opportunity to try out their ad features.
  - 2024-11-03 | Have you tried running a brand campaign? If so, did you find it effective?
  - 2024-11-03 | Has anyone here received Amazon’s email offer for $200 off a brand ads campaign? Can we use this opportunity to set up a campaign for Black Friday? If so, could we get a tutorial on how to do it? <@536075832658231299>
  - 2024-11-03 | Is anyone else having issues with advertising data not showing up?
  - 2024-11-03 | Cool! I'll look into it.
  - 2024-11-02 | learned something new!
  - 2024-11-02 | I was thinking about running a limited time deal, but Amazon doesn't let me do it because of their restriction. <@931213533134344222>  and I was just chatting about it. lol
  - 2024-11-01 | I look at it as giving Amazon some free labor at first, in return for better listing rankings down the line, while just trying to break even so I can keep going.
  - 2024-10-31 | Could we get access to the recording of this Zoom call?

  - 2024-11-11 | Does anyone have a website for their store? Or experience in making a website for their brand? What website hosting tool did you use? I used wix before but it's kind of expensive so I'm looking into other options, Hostinger seems to be good?
  - 2024-11-09 | I had this same error but I tried again after a few hours and it went away. Save your listing as a draft and come back to submit it again later and see if the error is still there
  - 2024-10-30 | Thank you Minh!
  - 2024-10-30 | Ok my listing has not shown up yet. There is nothing under there. I guess I have to wait for them to review?
  - 2024-10-30 | Hello yes I watched the harmful tutorial just now but it didn't show how to get the ASIN. Is there another tutorial to get ASIN?
  - 2024-10-30 | For the  Exemption sheets for battery and harmful chemicals - do I wait until I have my product to submit or should I submit with the dummy listing? If I submit with dummy listing where do I get ASIN?

  - 2024-10-28 | 
  - 2024-10-28 | in making an amazon seller account what is the "company registration number" mean? I googled it and it says it's not the EIN?
  - 2024-10-24 | The supplier said 8-15 days so I hope that is true. But the website said Nov 22
  - 2024-10-24 | Online it says by Nov 22 which is a whole month. I hope it arrives sooner than that!
  - 2024-10-24 | I found a supplier but shipping for the sample was $16-23!!! I managed to negotiate to $13 but this item is small around 1 pound. Is it normally this expensive? It's as much as a unit price!!
  - 2024-10-24 | Was there a document that used to be here? This module was blank in the Vetting supplier guide
  - 2024-10-22 | Yes, I would love that. May I please have an intro with Macy? Thank you very much!

  - 2024-10-21 | Does this mean I have to continue product research?
  - 2024-10-21 | Can I ask why car electronic is not allowed?
  - 2024-10-21 | Are you not able to see the product and the link from air table? It asks us to submit the product keyword and a link to the product when we submit the analysis. I assumed you knew what product it is
  - 2024-10-21 | It is car electronic
  - 2024-10-21 | What is car electric category?

  - 2024-11-09 | Thank you brothers and sisters means a lot ❤️
  - 2024-11-08 | Hi Shifu fam, I had a rough past couple of months and stepped away from pursuing my Amazon journey. I’ve decided that I want to finish this journey even though I stopped for many months. I know it’s not gonna be easy but it’s better to finish something rather than stop half way through and not know the outcome. Thank you <@975774205658411068>  for guiding me to get back on track and this Shifu community! Also, this is my punishment 100 pushups.
  - 2024-11-13 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> can you check your DM please thank you
  - 2024-11-17 | Yes 👍
  - 2024-11-17 | I do not have market analysis sheet now
  - 2024-11-16 | This was my product/brand in the making
  - 2024-11-16 | 
  - 2024-11-16 | So I haven’t been on track and just wanted to get your thoughts and run the numbers through again with my product that I worked on before I stopped

  - 2024-11-05 | How amazing!! Motivation boost for me! 🥰
  - 2024-10-14 | United States
  - 2024-11-12 | January would be best!! 😊
  - 2024-11-14 | I’m assuming she could use the reference ID here?
  - 2024-11-14 | 
  - 2024-11-14 | Where exactly can I find my reference ID??
  - 2024-11-14 | She’s saying one package got to port already and needs the reference ID to make an appointment with  AMZ warehouse.
  - 2024-11-13 | Ok, thanks!
  - 2024-11-13 | Yes, I believe so.
  - 2024-11-13 | Is the reference and shipment ID different?
  - 2024-11-13 | Correct
  - 2024-11-13 | She was saying how my tracking number for the shipment was incorrect
  - 2024-11-13 | Yeah, she was asking for reference ID
  - 2024-11-13 | I am confused. Because I did sea shipping. I was not given a tracking #. I ended up using random numbers for it.
  - 2024-11-13 | Is it because when I input the tracking # I just used a series of random numbers that’s why when she checked it was wrong.
  - 2024-11-13 | My freight forwarder told me that the shipping # is wrong for the one warehouse. Is ghat something I would just fix on my side??
  - 2024-10-30 | Thank you <@308107877493768193> ! It worked for me!
  - 2024-10-30 | The tracking Id should be at least 8 characters long correct?
  - 2024-10-30 | I tried inputting random numbers and letters and it’s saying it’s not recognized.
  - 2024-10-29 | What would I put as the tracking ID if that’s the case?
  - 2024-10-29 | Yes it’s sea shipping
  - 2024-10-29 | My freight forwarder should be the one providing me with the tracking ID correct? She seems to not understand and have been giving me the FBA ID instead.
  - 2024-10-29 | Was I given the wrong information?
  - 2024-10-29 | VGT2: JCR FBA18HVMPPP9  
AVP1: JCRFBA18HVPO42S  
RDU2:  JCRFBA18HVC8NJJ 
IAH3:   JCRFBA18HVOPCOW5 
RMN3:  JCRFBA18HVHJ785，


I was given this as the tracking ID?? But it’s showing on my side that is the Amazon fba box label # not tracking ID?
  - 2024-10-16 | I'm doing all sea shipping. She was able to give me a better offer. Thanks!
  - 2024-10-16 | She was able to offer me $583 for shipping fee. Then Macy offered $125 for inspection fee. Does that sound like a reasonable price?
  - 2024-10-16 | My supplier showed me this example
  - 2024-10-16 | I saw one video , labels for shipper but doesn’t show where exactly I can go to create the label for it.
  - 2024-10-16 | Where can I get the inner box barcode label? Is there a video showing that?
  - 2024-10-15 | Okay cool. I’ll wait to see what she says. Thanks!
  - 2024-10-15 | So I would just compare this with Macy and if she is able to offer inspection at a lower price I’ll go with her?
  - 2024-10-15 | Just to confirm. Where it says inspection would be the total cost for inspection correct?
  - 2024-10-15 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | So then it would be a total of 10 boxes since I am doing 200 units for my first batch correct?
  - 2024-10-14 | I’m wondering if I input it correctly?
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | This is what my supplier gave me. I am a bit confused on how to input the carton of units.
  - 2024-10-14 | 
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you guys!!
  - 2024-10-14 | Is there a video showing which warehouse I should be sending my products to?? I remember seeing somewhere try to send to two different warehouses??
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you!
  - 2024-10-14 | Also, since yall have experience which would save me more money. Would it be using her to do the inspection or alibaba inspection which would be the better option yall think?
  - 2024-10-14 | Macy was asking for checklist for inspection. Where can I get that?
  - 2024-10-14 | Thank you. I’ll reach out to her!
  - 2024-10-13 | The shipping was quite pricey on supplier side so I will have the shipping agent help with as she will give me a better deal on it.
  - 2024-10-13 | My batch is ready. How do I go about inspection and who would I go to for that?
  - 2024-10-10 | Most of my friends I am asking for fbm review  are from NC. As long as they’ve never used my WiFi it should be okay right? I’m wondering how much I can ask before it gets too much from the same state I’m living in..
  - 2024-10-10 | Okay, how can I schedule a call?
  - 2024-10-10 | Is there something I should be doing on the google sheet side that I'm missing??
  - 2024-10-10 | On my screen i have no options for lookup column nor lookup value? Why is that?
  - 2024-10-29 | My daily top 2: 
1. Work on finalizing shipments 
2. start research on A+ listing

  - 2024-10-26 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> , 

Sorry Idk why I didn’t get this notification but yea so I filed my trademark using a third party service like how I filed my llc through legalzoom. Just to save money and just having small issues back and forth. Overall just been slow process for me because I had to await samples and now feedbacks from friends/family. Once my trademark is straightened up, I will complete my brand registry
  - 2024-10-17 | Great, thanks

  - 2024-11-17 | I think the issue was that I had put another market place instead of the us so i went ahead and make new a listing for it so now I am able to print the item label
  - 2024-11-17 | on the good news I got the item label
  - 2024-11-17 | yeah air duster
ohhhh okay Ill go ahead and ask my supplier for that as well
  - 2024-11-16 | <@536075832658231299>  I didnt do the battery exemption sheet cause the product does have battery in it. 

CC: <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444>
  - 2024-11-16 | wait another day to see if anything changes ?
  - 2024-11-16 | Should I create a new listing ?
  - 2024-11-16 | 
  - 2024-11-16 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> <@1059659092475531444> 

still having the same issue from yesterday
  - 2024-11-15 | Hi <@1054411267340763216> let me try it again tonight. Currently stuck at the work office
  - 2024-11-15 | yeah was trying to trouble shoot this but stuck at the moment
  - 2024-11-15 | but I got confused when speaking with them on the phone
  - 2024-11-15 | the item label to apply on the box
  - 2024-11-15 | Cause I thought you just need to hit print label item and it should be good to go ?
  - 2024-11-15 | unless it should be a quick print ?
  - 2024-11-15 | contact seller suppor team and these are steps they told me before printing out the label (barcode)
  - 2024-11-15 | watching the the tutorial minh sent over too. trying to retrace my steps and seeing where I went wrong but cant seem troubleshoot correctly to find the root cause
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | <@1059659092475531444> clicked "print item label" from FBA listing and this pop up
  - 2024-11-15 | <@1059659092475531444> this is what i have at the moment
  - 2024-11-15 | just got this email
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | its on FBA
  - 2024-11-15 | So i did that  and having the same issue
  - 2024-11-15 | i think it has to be realting to the label
  - 2024-11-15 | my supplier asked me just now
  - 2024-11-15 | what does it mean by shipping is mark ?
  - 2024-11-15 | okay let me try that
  - 2024-11-15 | is there a way to change it or do i need to create another listing ?
  - 2024-11-15 | cause I believe i had create this one and select FMB
  - 2024-11-15 | so making a listing for fba ?
  - 2024-11-15 | ohhhh okay
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | just trying to see if i have miss anything
  - 2024-11-15 | it should be there but each time I press it it said item not submiteed
  - 2024-11-15 | Im trying to print the label item so I can sent it to my supplier
  - 2024-11-15 | Hello guys
  - 2024-10-20 | got it thanks for clearing it up on that for now i will select one just get things going
  - 2024-10-20 | How would I go about this ?
  - 2024-10-20 | When trying to pick a warehouse loation, there is not one in the state where my LLC regiestered. in this case should I go ahead and pick one in CA ??
  - 2024-10-18 | I will probably use a warehouse in the state my LLC is registered so that it make okay for now
  - 2024-10-18 | for the meantime
  - 2024-10-18 | thanks for head up but will see where this lead to
  - 2024-10-18 | oh nooooo
  - 2024-10-18 | when you said there no issue on shipping
  - 2024-10-18 | but I rather take that route to be honest
  - 2024-10-18 | but after this make more sense
  - 2024-10-18 | yeah cause I was gonna use a warehouse location in wyoming for now
  - 2024-10-18 | okay that alot more sense now
  - 2024-10-18 | ohhhhh okay
  - 2024-10-18 | not sure if that was the right reponse but it was a try
  - 2024-10-18 | i think for their shipping quote is through sea freight with DDP (postal service)
  - 2024-10-18 | its for the tax exempt part
  - 2024-10-18 | until everything is finalize then it will be change
  - 2024-10-18 | cause I was gonna give my supplier one of the warehouse from the state that my LLC is registered in for now
  - 2024-10-18 | from their side ?
  - 2024-10-18 | not sure which warehouse
  - 2024-10-18 | shipping is $423
  - 2024-10-18 | yes that is what I meant
  - 2024-10-18 | Good morning Minh 

Ohhhhh okay that make more sense thanks for clearing it up

For the estimate shipping cost that even applied if the supplier give you the shipping cost with the MOQ as well ?
  - 2024-10-18 | Yeah just need some clarification
  - 2024-10-18 | Cause my supplier need one confirm address but changing the address will change the freight as well
  - 2024-10-18 | just little bit more clarity I think
  - 2024-10-18 | Brand registry is currently in WIP/Hold but will reseume after placing the 30% down but need help with the address warehouse
  - 2024-10-18 | this is the process my supplier does
  - 2024-10-18 | 
  - 2024-10-18 | feel like Im overthinking this part
  - 2024-10-18 | trying to have a better understanding on this answer^^^^
  - 2024-10-18 | 
  - 2024-10-18 | because the process for my supplier is placing the 30% then started sending pcitures for the brand registration
  - 2024-10-18 | for this when placing the 30% do i select one in the state that my LLC is set up

  - 2024-11-11 | Credit card application question: When applying for the Chase Ink card, what Business Classification should I use for Amazon FBA. Typically I look for Online Retailer or E-commerce but not seeing it. Wondering what others have used. cc: <@1303784097738395718>
  - 2024-11-06 | ok, perfect <@1054411267340763216>. Thanks for clarifying.
  - 2024-11-06 | So what do I put into the Model Number and Part Number? Dummy data or data from the competitor?
  - 2024-11-06 | Do I need to source my product before I setup the dummy listing or setup dummy listing first? The training says to get the model number and part number from the supplier but since I haven't sourced, do I need to do that first?

  - 2024-11-03 | Hope it works well for you! Sponsored display didn’t work out so well for me. But the free money was worth trying haha.
  - 2024-11-03 | I have not. But I will this week to test it. Mainly just to get the credits though. I did a promo for sponsored display ads and only had to launch it for a day before receiving credits.
  - 2024-11-03 | I’ve gotten about $700 in credits for ads. Definitely take advantage of those offers!
  - 2024-11-02 | That makes sense. My comparison is to the typical price that is slashed through. Cause that will drop as you sell more at a lower price.
  - 2024-11-02 | Ooh ok. So he’s just swapping between coupon and lightning deals. Very clever haha.
  - 2024-11-02 | But others will know more. That’s just from my little experience haha
  - 2024-11-02 | Yeah as long as you have more sales at the original price then the deals won’t get restricted.
  - 2024-11-02 | It’s a great idea for gaining visibility! But it can only be done for so long. As you keep selling at that lowered price Amazon will show that as your “typical price”. It’s to prevent sellers from having fake sales lol.

  - 2024-11-08 | From my experience, shipping during the holiday season is particularly tricky for the Amazon warehouse process. That is why Amazon always suggests that sellers begin holiday inventory prep as early as summer to avoid late shipping bottlenecks and your inventory should be in stock before October. For future holiday seasons, one of the best ways to avoid similar situations is to plan your shipments well ahead of time
  - 2024-11-07 | My shipment was missing 1-2 units when the Amazon warehouse received it, I claimed with my freight forwarder and got the credit back

I hope you’re doing well! I noticed that your homework for Han's class weekly wasn’t turned in on time. I just wanted to check in with you and see if everything is alright. Is there something that got in the way of getting it done?

If you need some support or need more time for homework, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's work together to come up with a plan so you can stay on track moving forward 🙂
  - 2024-11-15 | This is the shipping label brother, sorry I am confused. Are you talking about the shipping label (apply on the carton for shipping to Amazon warehouse) or the item label (apply on the box)?
  - 2024-11-15 | you can click on "print item label" from FBA listing
  - 2024-11-15 | can you capture the manage listings please?
  - 2024-11-15 | I think  maybe they are asking about the shipping label
  - 2024-11-15 | 
  - 2024-11-15 | You can do both FBM and FBA on the same ASIN
On your FBM listing, select "Add another condition" and set it up as FBA. This will create a new FBA listing for the same ASIN with a new SKU
  - 2024-11-15 | I think you printed the item label from FBM listing
  - 2024-11-15 | May I ask do you create FBA listing?

  - 2024-11-15 | Okay got it. Thank you
  - 2024-11-15 | Ah that was my mistake. I searched and used my original one.

  - 2024-11-15 | This should be the spreadsheet that says “add a product that is already listed”?
  - 2024-11-15 | Okay I deleted it. I’ll wait another 24 hours to redo it and upload a blank spreadsheet to see what red outline ones are needed
  - 2024-11-15 | I just went to inventory and somehow the spreadsheet created my listing. I still have the OLD title eventhough I uploaded a spreadsheet after 24 hours
  - 2024-11-15 | I am trying to upload the Spreadsheet and I have these 2 errors.
1. I put in my exact inventory. What would this require? or do I put 0?
2. Do I make a new SKU? I ran it with the SKU they provided, then I Ran another one with my old SKU. Both gave me these errors
  - 2024-11-13 | Thank you
  - 2024-11-13 | I see okay. I can do that
  - 2024-11-13 | okay. So delete first then reupload the spreadsheet? or vice versa?
  - 2024-11-13 | what about the current inventory that has the ASIN printed on them?
  - 2024-11-13 | this has to create a new ASIN?
  - 2024-11-13 | wouldn't it be a lot faster?
  - 2024-11-13 | curious to know why the "copy" listing doesnt work better?
  - 2024-11-13 | okay I will try that out
  - 2024-11-13 | correct
  - 2024-11-13 | or close it?
  - 2024-11-13 | Create a new one then delete the old one?
  - 2024-11-13 | no I dont have to
  - 2024-11-13 | and create a new listing?
  - 2024-11-13 | so I will update all the info and type it in
  - 2024-11-13 | but I didn't copy everything over. I just tried to refresh the current one
  - 2024-11-13 | I did it yesterday with the partial update
  - 2024-11-13 | Okay. I will do that
  - 2024-11-13 | Hmm so far out. Let me try to do it on my own first lol. So I can adjust it before this weekend
  - 2024-11-07 | I wasn’t able to attend his class yesterday so I didn’t get a chance to send anything in yet. 

I am still in the process of moving  some of my work schedules around for the weekly meeting
  - 2024-11-01 | Thank you! I’m glad to be back and in need of some help. I’m already working on some tips Justin has given me and seeing how that goes in the next couple of weeks

  - 2024-11-16 | Thank you Justin for today's coaching lesson. It gave me a lot of insight and perspective in life and how I can show up for myself to create a stronger mindset. 1% each day.

This week was a very emotional week for me and my family. Our dog passed away… it’s been a lot to process. Going through a roller coaster of emotions gave me a reminder that even though my world felt like it stopped, in the real world - life still continues.

I didn’t meet all my goals set for this week but next week will be different. My goals for next week are:

1. 1 hour every day for Product Research
2. Listen to audible book
3. Look on other social media platforms for ideas on product
  - 2024-11-13 | Goal 1 - Continue PR and committing an hour each day
Goal 2 - complete 1-2 product analysis 
Goal 3 - sign up for Pilates class to get more active and energized
  - 2024-11-10 | This week was my first week fully committing myself to product search. It definitely took some time to learn and understand the criteria before getting myself into a mini-groove.. it’s kinda fun.  

Personally, it’s been kind of rough. Working full-time, managing the household with a toddler, and starting this AMZ journey has been quite an adjustment. I also just learned I’m going to hit busy season at work and it’s all coming at me very fast so a bit stressed lately. I think I’ll be okay, just going to push through… it’s just a little hard right now. 

Note: I noticed a lot of my product researches are not top sellers. I’m not sure why, but I will continue doing product research next week. 

GREAT job to everyone doing an amazing job with or without kids!!
  - 2024-11-07 | Weekly goals

  - 2024-11-03 | My main goal for last week is to order samples from supplier agents, but I've been facing many distractions from social media.
Goals for Next Week:
1. Read the book The 4 hours work week.
2.Watch videos to prepare for finance.
3.Find an accountability partner.
  - 2024-10-28 | After talking with Shifu Han and watching the video "How to Build Your AM/PM Millionaire Routine" by Shifu Justin, my life has changed dramatically. Before this, I really wanted to succeed on my journey, but I wasn't committed and didn't know how to make it happen. I failed the first time, but now, with coaching from Han and the mindset I’ve gained from this course, I’ve transformed my habits.

My big win is waking up early at 6:00 AM, working deeply until 7:30, and then walking for 30 minutes before getting ready for work. These are habits I never practiced before. My journey feels much smoother now, and I'm grateful for everything, including my past failures, which have helped me grow.

  - 2024-11-11 | Last week has been a pretty emotion ride. I am worried about how the next four years would affect me, my family, my Amazon FBA business, and the relationships from my extended family members who do not share my views and morals. I take a look at my vision board and have a sense of worry if I could achieve those goals with the possible limitations of the future state of our country. 

However, Shifu Charlie's Mindset Class today really helped me calm those worries. It's true that we cannot control everything in the broader aspects of politics and our country. But what we can control are the choices we make and the people we surround ourselves with. And I will continue to strive to work towards my vision board goals no matter what happens. And it starts with my Amazon FBA business.

If anyone ever needs any support during this emotional time after the elections, I am always here to lend an ear and help out!

  - 2024-11-01 | Welcome Judy and Emily!
  - 2024-10-22 | Great! I’ve requested you as a friend. Let’s DM each other now.
  - 2024-10-22 | Welcome <@1031622651468333076>! Happy to be your accountability partner as you get started on your Amazon FBA journey!
  - 2024-11-07 | Congrats <@1292032925964959755>! Let's crush it together!
  - 2024-11-06 | Amazing work guys!
  - 2024-10-10 | Yes finally! Thank you Minh for reviewing!
  - 2024-10-05 | Thanks for the tip!
  - 2024-10-02 | I unfortunately can’t join PR classes due to my baby’s bedtime but will watch the videos and submit 4 more product analysis tomorrow morning.
  - 2024-10-01 | thank you I see it! Will review,
  - 2024-10-01 | Thanks Minh. I will share that today along with another product that is relatively new in the market. Did you review the 3 products I submitted to the Product Support Request form on Friday?
  - 2024-09-30 | <@1054411267340763216> Question: If the product is a new market (only $500K-$600K total revenue) and doesn't have any seller making above $100K, is it still a good product to go after? All sellers are new sellers with 100 reviews or less. Or should I keep this product on a watchlist and see how it grows over time? Top sellers are making $18K, $44K, and $47K.

  - 2024-11-06 | Now that the elections are over, I am wondering how our Amazon FBA businesses would be affected when it comes to tariffs and imports from China. Does that mean our products and production costs would be higher?
  - 2024-10-25 | I've ordered two samples already too and one of them I order last week will arrive today so mine took about a week. Mine was shipped via UPS.
  - 2024-10-22 | Thank you <@536075832658231299> and <@1066465177140215928> for answering!
  - 2024-10-22 | Is there a state that we should search the Amazon warehouse in like California?
  - 2024-10-22 | Is there a shipping address that I can use to get shipping quotes from suppliers? I assume the address would be an Amazon warehouse to receive our products?

  - 2024-10-20 | nvm I think it checked data on page 2 or something which is why it was low revenue?
  - 2024-10-20 | I just checked my product's market again today and total revenue went down to $50K. Is this something to be concerned if my product is not potential anymore?
  - 2024-10-17 | When ordering samples, it’s just to sample the product? No logo or custom box needed?
  - 2024-10-17 | I have one supplier that would only do custom box for 1000 MOQ. How important is it to have a custom box for launch?
  - 2024-10-16 | Okay thank you for your response <@1054411267340763216> and <@1066465177140215928>. I am able to negotiate down to 300 MOQ with black or gray color instead.
  - 2024-10-16 | Is it worth settling for a high MOQ of 1000 if I want to do a customized color for my product? Currently in the market, there are many black or gray colors. I noticed that the top selling competitor's product is a silver color.
  - 2024-10-14 | Did this happen because of the battery? Do I need to apply for that GTIN exemption?
  - 2024-10-14 | So should I already have found a supplier before making a dummy listing? Han said that the dummy listing doesn't need to be 100% correct so I haven't found a supplier yet.
  - 2024-10-14 | So my product has a battery, I'm not sure what type of battery and I tried to look at my competitor's listing to see if they list it but cannot find it. How should I fill out the battery questions?
  - 2024-10-13 | <@1054411267340763216> Just checking to see when you will share my product analysis for 15 and 16?
  - 2024-10-10 | ok thank you Han for answering!
  - 2024-10-10 | So I started Module 2 - Do I find a supplier first before creating a dummy listing? Minh said in the dummy listing video that I would need to get the product details like model number, etc. from the supplier.
  - 2024-10-10 | Hi <@536075832658231299>! I've completed intro module and module 1. Starting on Module 2 today.
  - 2024-11-01 | DONE <@1031622651468333076>
  - 2024-10-22 | Hi <@613172337470341150> fellow ENFP! Are you post-launch stage? Would love another accountability partner that is a stage ahead of me so that I can learn from your experience.
  - 2024-10-22 | <@1031622651468333076> Happy to be your accountability partner as your start your Amazon FBA journey!

  - 2024-11-12 | Hi. In my first order, I had 5 shipments. One shipment did not have a tracking number and was delivered via POD+ISA, so now my current defect rate is at 20%. I got a defect type for not inputting a tracking number. Should I submit the dispute and select the option in the screenshot?

  - 2024-11-08 | 
  - 2024-11-08 | Hi Han, I noticed my items for the variation title doesn't match my parent variation, so I attempted to edit the item name and get this error attached.  Do I need to do it another way to update the item name?
