We would like to take this moment to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who generously donated to our cause. With the hustle of preparation and budgeting, organizing has proven to be quite challenging, especially with the time zone differences and varying availabilities in the Philippines. However, despite these obstacles, we are committed to fulfilling our mission with grateful hearts.

On behalf of myself, <@1100405164432707645> , and my brother Ruben, we extend our sincerest thanks to each and every one of you for your unwavering support. Special thanks to <@985885913320132629>   <@975774205658411068>  <@536075832658231299> <@705204493620478032>  <@1054411267340763216>  for allowing us to share our journey here. Although it may seem like a small victory, we are thrilled to announce that we have achieved 78% of our target goal.

Thank you once again for your generosity and support!ü©µ üôèüèº

Rested a lot las few days and took a break from working since my head was in a fog. Was able to reschedule meeting with Minh, have been mostly consistent in waking up early to start sauna, & walk dog. Journaling hasn't been every day but have been getting it in more than before. Also finally found a product and spent last week finishing module 2, creating AMZ seller account, got my EIN & business CC.

Weekly Goal:
Wake up an hour earlier each day to start day with gratitude/meditation, sauna, journal & walking dog.
Work on sourcing at least 1 hour a day.

alycubo,Khoa,2023-08-12,2024-11-16,"Hi everyone, it's been a long time since I was active in this group, lol. While working on restocking, my supplier gave me a free sample of another product. I treated them like friends, and now they treat me very well and have been a huge help during my listing deactivation. Just wanted to share my experience. üòÅ",Active

This week was a very emotional week for me and my family. Our dog passed away‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a lot to process. Going through a roller coaster of emotions gave me a reminder that even though my world felt like it stopped, in the real world - life still continues.

I didn‚Äôt meet all my goals set for this week but next week will be different. My goals for next week are:

1. 1 hour every day for Product Research
2. Listen to audible book
3. Look on other social media platforms for ideas on product",Active
